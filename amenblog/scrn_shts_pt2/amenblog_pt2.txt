now we're gonna carry on from the previous article on the amen break to alter not just the pattern of the drum sequence, but the sound of the drums themselves:

- starting by loading the previous project from [recent projects] in the [file menu]:

- we switch the kits used from the amen sample slices to alternate ableton kits or any kits of our choosing

- duplicating the loops to make banks of 4

- we loop at different places

- we set follow actions for the groups of 4 so they play one after another in order, lopping back to start to repeat ad infinitum

-  we apply filtering and our chopper effect to switch between the two channels

- apply spatialisation via reverberation effects in the 'send/return' system.

- we bounce and trim the audio resulting

- we apply a new groove to the bounced output

- we bounce the result to a final consolidated bounce channel

- we lay down a recording to the arrange window and fix it withe crucial orange button

- exporting we have a long complex break of many bars with totally differents sound

- true blue, new beat!
