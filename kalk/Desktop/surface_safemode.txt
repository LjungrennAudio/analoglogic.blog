/	universal key for all emergency .txt files in my computer's c:\root for when i forget many moons/brain_clk_cycles from now... :

/	`wysiwyg`
/	`/` commented out (iirc win10 .reg files for example use `; ` to comment stuff out, but i'm holding too many various syntaxes in my limited brain_ram rn to 	/	switch back forth - afraid you get the ones most commonly used in my world, so most conventions are _sorta_ `C` or `py` related.)
/	`[]` button or mouse action
/	`{}` menu/textbox/etc. action sorta stuff.
/	`+` actions occur simultaneously e.g. to shiftclck a menu option saying restart would be [lshift]+[lclk]+restart
/	`()` i din't have any other brackets to use on kbd having used `[]` for hardware actions and reserving the normal for code function `{}` braces for
/	text/menu/screen actions.
/	finally, i'm not case sensitive. i don't capit(a/o)lise.* if it's got capitalisation though, when it's wysiwyg quote for code/url/path/cmd/etc. - i very much
/	mean to capitalise - often its referring either to something that is case sensitive or its because its a Widows10 or whoever other corporation's name who felt
/	it so necessary to communicte the impotence of their little achivement.


`[lshift]+{restart}`


/ note: restart from a win menu, i.e. soft as possible: login screen power symbol, win start button* etc. - technically you can access an EFI pseudo-bios setup by
/ holding [+vol]+[pwr] on the op left edge of surface screen/body unit itself, but holding any keyboard keys etc. wen using the main pwr button like tht doesnt access / the same win boot me option.


`{advanced options}`


`{XXXXXX}`

/ (secret hidden option that doesn't look like an option, i.e. its just words at the bottom of the page / not a button like all other options on the list:*)


`{6. SAFEMODE WITH COMMAND PROMPT}`


/ ...probably some circly thing ... waiting ... etc. then a reboot... circly things and waiting...


`{enter paassword for windows account _not_ pin or any other prior set/regularly used pass/id setting - you in safe mode, it doesn't know all tht fancy stuff ;) }`


/ should be offered a  frenly, safe good ol' `c:\Widows\system32>` prompt.
/ also remember, you not in wonderland anymore alice, this iis no longer the powershell pretendng to
/ be command prompt you get by default in win10 etc. - you in real command prompt only environment.


/ note: also relevant in general, the power button still behaves as you have it configured by last added/adjusted/etc. windows config settings, even in safmode or
/ until you actually get to a load point where windows changes setting and successfully writes new behaviour setting. i.e. if you have [pwr] set to {sleep} the hitting
/ power briefly/softtouch kinda manner will set the computer to sleep _not_ kill power/restart etc. when youre ready to exit safemode and reboot, you're best using the
/ cmd.exe command `shutdown /r`
/
/ re: cmd.exe `shutdown` -from c:\ in win10;
/		 `/s` (actually shutsdown)
/		 `/f` (forces all apps to close without warning)
/ 		 `/t {s}` (shutdown after {seconds} wait. {0} will shut down straight away)
/		 `/d [p|u:]xx:yy` (record message  in log as to why the fuck you did this):
/	(Reasons on this computer: types, `E` = Expected `U` = Unexpected `P` = planned; `C` = customer defined; xx = 0-255; yy = 0-65535)
/	here i am choosing `u:2:16` - Operating System Service Pack Unplanned...
/		 `/p` (instant death - no wait,  no warning, just kill)
/		 `/fw` (boots into the 'bios' upon reboot)
/		 `/o` (boots into advanced optios upon reboot)
/ so, from `c:\`, here goes: `shutdown /r /t 2 /d u:2:16`		Event Viewer > Windows Logs > System : info source User32  "Event ID" of 1074 will be this.
