The Izzet League are charged with attending to Ravnican civic works,[5] including water supply systems, sewers, heating systems, boilers, and roadways.[6][7] In addition to carrying out these functions, the Izzet members — obsessive, keen, and creative intellectuals, who often have short attention spans [8] — are known to perform magical experiments, ever with reckless abandon and sometimes with spectacular but severe results.[5][9][10] Unlike the other guilds, the Izzet do not openly strive for hegemony of the city and the plane. Instead, integral to the Izzet League, a guild of masters of both theoretical and applied science and spellcraft, is the passionate seeking of, and thirst for, knowledge.[11] Combined with their drive for discovery and child-like curiosity, the brilliant but capricious and whimsical Izzet magewrights jump to and from ideas as they see fit, discarding old ideas for new ones that attract their attention.[5] In this regard, they can be likened to ambivalent or benevolent mad and absent-minded scientists/professors.[12]
