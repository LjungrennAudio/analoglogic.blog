========


- A game of Magic starts with only players’ decks and life counters [D20] on the table, but once each player has had a few turns to play lands, cast spells, and attack with creatures, a kind of virtual gameboard begins to take shape.
- That gameboard is divided into several different game zones. below is what a board  might look like after a few turns:

			__________________

_________		__________________	__________________


LIBRARY
- Your library is your draw pile, which remains face down throughout the game. 
- You lose the game if you are forced to draw a card but cannot because your library is out of cards.

HAND
- You start the game by drawing a hand of seven cards.
- If you have more than seven cards in your hand as your turn ends, you must discard down to seven.

BATTLEFIELD
- You and your opponents share the battlefield.
- Cards that go onto the battlefield (including lands, creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) are called permanents.
- Instants and sorceries are never on the battlefield.
- You can arrange your permanents however you want (we recommend putting your lands closest to you), but your opponent must be able to see all of them.

GRAVEYARD
- Your graveyard is your discard pile: creatures that die, artifacts and enchantments that are destroyed, and cards you discard from your hand go here.
- The cards in your graveyard should always be face up, and anyone can look at them at any time. 
- Each player has their own graveyard.

EXILE
- If a spell or ability exiles a card, that card is set apart from the rest of the game.
- Cards in exile are normally face up.

THE STACK
- The stack is a game zone shared by all players (like the battlefield) where spells and abilities wait to resolve.
- [Resolving a spell or ability simply means that its effect happens.]

========


Each turn proceeds in the same sequence. 
Whenever you enter a new step or phase, any triggered abilities that happen during that step or phase trigger and are put on the stack. The active player (the player whose turn it is) gets to start casting spells and activating abilities, then each other player in turn order will too. When all players decline to do anything more and nothing is on the stack waiting to resolve, the game will move to the next step.

||The stack||

- When you cast a spell or activate an ability, it doesn’t resolve right away—it goes on the stack.
Spells and abilities remain on the stack until both players choose not to cast any new spells or activate any new abilities. Triggered abilities also go on the stack until they resolve.
- Each player has an opportunity to cast an instant spell (or activate an activated ability) in response to any spell or ability that goes on the stack.
- If a player does decide to respond, their spell or ability goes on the stack on top of what was already waiting there.
- When all players pass—that is, decline to do anything more—the top spell or ability on the stack will resolve.
- Spells and abilities remain on the stack until all players choose not to cast any new spells or activate any new abilities.

[After a spell or ability resolves, both players again get the chance to respond. If no one does, the next thing waiting on the stack will resolve.]

- A general rule is that spells and abilities on the stack resolve one by one, beginning with the last one put on the stack.

If the stack is empty, the current step of the turn will end, and the game will proceed to the next step.


========


Each triggered ability starts with the word "when," "whenever," or "at." You don’t activate a triggered ability — it automatically triggers whenever the condition or conditions stated in the first part of the ability are met.

An activated ability is an ability that you can activate whenever you want (like casting an instant), as long as you can pay the cost. Each activated ability is formatted in the same way: "Cost: Effect." Some activated abilities contain the  (tap) symbol in their costs; this means that you must tap that card to activate the ability. You can’t activate this kind of ability if the permanent is already tapped or if it’s a creature with summoning sickness.


========


------------

|BEGINNING PHASE|


_Untap step_
1. You untap all your tapped permanents.
[On the first turn of the game, you don’t have any permanents, so you just skip this step.]

- No one can cast spells or activate abilities during this step.


_Upkeep step_
1. Players can cast instants and activate abilities.

2. resolve stack
[This part of the turn is mentioned on a number of cards. If something is supposed to happen just once per turn, right at the beginning, an ability will trigger "at the beginning of your upkeep."]


_Draw step_
1. You must draw a card from your library (even if you don’t want to). 
[The player who goes first in a two-player game skips the draw step on their first turn to make up for the advantage of going first.]

2. Players can then cast instants and activate abilities.

3. resolve stack


------------

|FIRST MAIN PHASE|
1. You can cast any number of sorceries, instants, creatures, artifacts, enchantments, planeswalkers and up to one land.
[you can play a land in second phase alternatively]

2. you can activate abilities. 

3. Your opponent can cast instants and activate abilities.

4. resolve stack


-
[You can play one land during each of your turns. To play a land, just put it from your hand onto the battlefield during either of the main phases of your turn.]
-
[Creatures enter the battlefield with "summoning sickness," which means that a creature you control can’t attack (or use an ability that has  in its cost) until it starts your turn under your control. You can block with a creature no matter how long it’s been on the battlefield]
-
[Enchantments have persistent magical effects that affect the game as long as they’re on the battlefield. Like creatures, you can cast an enchantment as a spell during your main phase, and it remains on the battlefield unless it’s destroyed, sacrificed, exiled, or otherwise removed.]
-
[Sorceries are spells that you can cast only during a main phase of your turn. They have a one-time effect. You do what the spell says, and then put the card into your graveyard.]
-
[Instants are spells that can be cast at any time, even during your opponent’s turn or during combat. Like sorceries, instants have a one-time effect, and then you put them into your graveyard.]
-


------------

|COMBAT PHASE|

-
The middle phase of each turn is the combat phase.
[In your combat phase, you choose which of your creatures will attack, and you choose which opponents they will attack.]
-
The most common way to win the game is to attack with your creatures.
[If a creature that is attacking an opponent isn’t blocked, it deals damage equal to its power to that opponent.]
[If damage is dealt to your opponent, they lose that much life.]
-


_Beginning of combat step_
1. Players can cast instants and activate abilities.

2. resolve stack?


Once a spell has been cast, one of two things happens.
1. If the spell is an instant or a sorcery, you follow the instructions on the card, and then you put the card into your graveyard.

2. If the spell is a creature, artifact, or enchantment, you put the card on the table in front of you. The card is now on the battlefield.
[Cards on the battlefield are called permanents to differentiate them from instants and sorceries, which are never on the battlefield.]


_Declare attackers step_
1. You decide which, if any, of your untapped creatures will attack, and which player or planeswalker they will attack.
[Tap your creatures to show that they are attacking.]

2. Players can then cast instants and activate abilities.

3. resolve stack


_Declare blockers step_
1. Your opponents then choose which of their creatures will block, if any.
[Tapped creatures can’t be declared as blockers.]
[If multiple creatures block a single attacker, you order the blockers to show which will be first to receive damage, which will be second, and so on.]

2. Players can then cast instants and activate abilities.

3. Once all blockers have been chosen, each creature—both attackers and blockers—simultaneously deals damage equal to its power.


_Combat damage step_
1. An attacking creature that isn’t blocked deals damage to the player it’s attacking.

2. An attacking creature that is blocked deals damage to the creature or creatures that are blocking it, and vice versa.

3. If one of your attacking creatures is blocked by multiple creatures, you decide how to divide its combat damage among them.

4. [You must assign at least enough damage to the first blocking creature to destroy it before you can assign damage to the second one, and so on.

5. Each attacking or blocking creature that’s still on the battlefield assigns its combat damage to
- the defending player (if it’s attacking that player and wasn’t blocked),
- to a planeswalker (if it’s attacking that planeswalker and wasn’t blocked),
- to the creature or creatures blocking it, or to the creature it’s blocking.

6. If an attacking creature is blocked by multiple creatures, you divide its combat damage among them by assigning at least enough damage to the first blocking creature to destroy it, then by assigning damage to the second one, and so on.

7. Once players decide how the creatures they control will deal their combat damage, the damage is all dealt at the same time.

8. Players can then cast instants and activate abilities.

9. resolve stack


[If a creature is dealt damage equal to or greater than its toughness over the course of a single turn (whether it be combat damage, damage from spells or abilities, or a combination of both), that creature is destroyed, and it goes to its owner’s graveyard (or "dies").] 
[If a creature takes damage that isn’t enough to destroy it in a single turn, that creature stays on the battlefield, and the damage wears off _at the end of the turn_.]


_End of combat step_
1. Players can cast instants and activate abilities.

2. resolve stack


------------

|SECOND MAIN PHASE|


1. Your second main phase is just like your first main phase - You can cast any type of spell and activate abilities,

2. your opponent can only cast instants and activate abilities.

3. resolve stack?

[You can play a land during this phase if you didn’t play one during your first main phase.]


------------

|ENDING PHASE|


_End step_
[Abilities that trigger “at the beginning of your end step” go on the stack.]

1. Players can cast instants and activate abilities.

2. Resolve stack


_Cleanup step_
1. If you have more than seven cards in your hand, choose and discard cards until you have only seven.

2. Next, all damage on creatures is removed and all “until end of turn” effects end.

3. No one can cast instants or activate abilities unless an ability triggers during this step.

4. resolve stack

========


- 	If a spell has the text "Destroy target creature," but there are no creatures on the 	battlefield, you can’t 	cast that spell because it has no valid targets.

- 	If a spell "deals damage to any target," you can choose any creature or player (or 	planeswalker, if a player has one) as a target for that spell.

-	[Once you choose targets, you can’t change your mind later. When the spell or 		ability resolves, it checks the targets to make sure they’re still legal (that is, 	they’re still there and they still match the requirements of the spell or ability) 	If a target isn’t legal, the spell or ability can’t affect it. If none of the 		targets are legal, the spell or ability does nothing at all.]

- 	Death touch
	702.2b A creature with toughness greater than 0 that’s been dealt damage by a source 	with deathtouch since the last time state-based actions were checked is destroyed as 	a state-based action. See rule 704.

- 	Exile	
	406.1. The exile zone is essentially a holding area for objects. Some spells 	and 	abilities exile an object without any way to return that object to another zone. 	Other spells and abilities exile an object only temporarily.
	406.2. To exile an object is to put it into the exile zone from whatever zone it’s 	currently in. An exiled card is a card that’s been put into the exile zone.

- 	Surveil	
	701.42a To “surveil N” means to look at the top N cards of your library, then put 	any number of them into your graveyard and the rest on top of your library in any 	order.

- 	Vigilance
	702.20a Vigilance is a static ability that modifies the rules for the declare 		attackers step.
	702.20b Attacking doesn’t cause creatures with vigilance to tap. (See rule 508, 	“Declare Attackers Step.”)

	[508.1a The active player chooses which creatures that they control, if any, will 	attack. The chosen creatures must be untapped, and each one must either have haste 	or have been controlled by the active player continuously since the turn began.]

- 	Menace
	702.110b A creature with menace can’t be blocked except by two or more creatures. 	(See rule 509, “Declare Blockers Step.”)

-	Mill a card
	To mill a number of cards, a player puts that many cards from the top of their 		library into their graveyard. See rule 701.13.

- 	Converted mana cost
	The total amount of mana in a mana cost, regardless of color. See rule 202.3.
