- avail moslyt blue, needed similar - much any in balance 
- avail wtd less moar blue, needed wtd equalish - much less any in balance but still near double

seems ok or need to replace 50% blue with Cls fancies?

note - forsook monument = x2 Cls avail when tapping for Cls, kefnet monument - blue creat. A less
