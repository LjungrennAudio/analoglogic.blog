Some of the most popular social media websites, with more than 100 million registered users, include Facebook (and its associated Facebook Messenger), TikTok, WeChat, Instagram, QZone, Weibo, Twitter, Tumblr, Baidu Tieba, and LinkedIn. Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services include YouTube, QQ, Quora, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest, Viber, Reddit, Discord, VK, Microsoft Teams, and more. Wikis are examples of collaborative content creation. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media#cite_note-23]

social media is generally free to use/take part in and yet provides access to probably more people and specicallly/crucially tageted audiences than any other form of media or platform. since its the way the modern person is more than likely to encounter information if searching for info or just browsing and is interested in tech, gaming, digital art/music, porn and more it would be foolih not to use it as the main avenue for marketing and promotion of said things.

13 main recognised types of social media are - relevant ones to this blog are starred, and explanations follow:

- *social networks; the main browsed media form that reaches max audience fast and effectively,
- *video sharing; youtube etc get high volume long duration viewing with alot of follow on clicks,
- *photo sharing; instagram etc get a lot of repeat visits and follow on clicks,
- *blogs; more likely to get in depth reads and deeper attention,
- *social gaming; appeals muchly to certain audience,
- *social bookmarking; pinterest etc. allow personalisation of targeted content to a high degree making follow on clicks more popular,
- virtual worlds,
- forums,
- microblogs,
- products/services review,
- enterprise social networking,
- business networks,
- collaborative project management,

the takeaway from all this is if you have something to monetise or promote - yourself [as an artist, camgirl], a product, artwork/music, streaming options etc then you need to sell yourself and the way to do it is by social media.

the good news is: social media is basically free, easy, highly automatable, and effectively can reach a huge _targeted_ audience for little effort or need for anything more than a basic smartphone.

unfortunately social media is a big popularity contest - its available to anyone and everyone and hence anyone and everyone is using these avenues
its a pissing contest - whoever shouts loudest/longest gets the attention, but, stop shouting for one day and you sink back into the obscurity of the masses.

so how does one circumvent these issues? 

post often/regularly - it doesnt even matter too much what you post! an insta of a photo of your pet, a tweet of some philosophical thought   in your head when you wake, a short blog on how great vaping is compared to cigs - anything.
crucially, do a little thing every day - especially at first - keep your followers interested and entertained, draw in new followers and keep ahead of the competition.
if youve got a backlog of art/photography/music/thoughts/poetry/wjatever, make use and use it as a stock.
theres services and softwares to automate this daily tweet/insta/whatever posting - take advantage and save yourself work, likewise, use the crosspost functions of things like insta/fb to minimise the number of repeat actions

finally, take advantage of every platform and outlet there is - the more links that search engines pick up, the better your seo, the more nodes you create, the more content you create, the more interconnecting links in the world wide network of stuff associatd with your self/brand/product the more chance you appear higher on the search engine results, get reposted/retweeted/followed etc - you want exposure, maxiumum exzposure and with as little manual connection making at our end as possible - you want it to run itself as much as possible.


how do you set all this up?

the effective aim for this no matter what is to sell something - whether literally sell a product, get people to pay for you to do whatever, or simply get listens/views.

i.e. you are pushing a brand.

you need to creat a unique brand identity.


1. choose a name for 'self'/brand/business identity/product/artist identity/whatever

- it needs to be memorable [i.e. shortish or clever, easy t spell and spot in a big morass] 
- it needs to be unique [if there's 20 others and youre johnx13 people will get confused or not remember you or just write you off already]
- it needs to avooid spaces/hyphens/brackets etc. since often these arent universally allowed in naming options of platforms
- it needs to be available as a name on all the social media platforms you want to use so after you think youve chosen, gongle it - see if its taken.


2. all these social media platforms etc work by registering using an email and a password. although what you use technically doesnt matter [and hence you can use one of your existing emails with a password manager], here's an opportunity to setup a custom email that not only can be universal to all your platform id's but also is unique for your brand, easy to remember for all access and allows people to contact you separately to other private emails you may use.

therefore i suggest set up a gmail account using the new name and let the password manager handle passwords so you dont have to keep loseable lists, remember things, store stuff crossplatform in non-concurrent txt files or any other risky practices.


3. choose a brand image - something clean, simple, effective and eye catching even whe quite small that works in  circle. 90% of social media platforms use an avatar as the main brand id since they were generally made with the idea people would put a photo of their fae. this has long since chaned but the circular smol avatar format perssts


4. set up an allmylinks and a linktree using tthat email - crucially under your new brand name. even though you may not yeet hav  much content to put in these pages these will be crucial for setting up the other platform i.d's.
- if youre selling yourself consider whats either your most relevant features, or target audience - do you need to look sexy/atractive? stylised? cool to specific audience? let your market define how you present yourself to a degree but also dont just lose your identity - make you the best you not someone elses - for example a cam girl might choose to be very pretty and well photographed but following classic rules like 'looking downwards slightly appears generally more attractive', smoll images need slightly exaggerated makeup to have it visible in a photo, showing too much isnt as good as just head because you give away too much and theres no mystery left to tease people in, but, you can hold an object or show a little cleavage etc.
- if a music artist you might want a logo or similar.
- if selling a procuct you want to follow classiic brand rules, techniques and advices.


5. setup identities on
a) Facebook - specifically a fb business account [if you have an existing fb then you _can_ set that as a manager account so that you have access, control and emergency control over your new fb without losing privacy]; fb businesses dont force you into the public eye and behave as intrusively as personal accounts [to the same degree.]
b) instagram
c) wordpress blog
d) twitter
e) youtube
f) optional specific things like a website for those who can design/build/create/host;  bandcamp/soundcloud/mixcloud for musicians; pinterest for artists; etc
g) optional Reddit, Kik, snapchat, tiktok and instagram group as relevant

put as the main or even only link on all these places under 'webpage' or whatever you allmylinks

6. return to allmylinks/linktree and put all the links to the above platforms in.

7. youll also need a few extra touches to look real slikc and professional - a 'banner' [some platforms, along wwith allmylinks itself allow for a screenwidth approx avatar height banner image that adds extra customisation/personalisation to your page. its a major etra part of branding. as a general rule you will notice on most websites, banners and in general colour pallettes are no more than three colours total and so considering your brand logo/photo/whatever is likely two have two domintant colours at avatar size already its not wise to pick more than one further complimentary colour - this should really be the colour palette and scheme for any website, brand id and the whole business setup as a whole too]

8.fundamentally, do what you do because you love it, use your passion for it to inspire and motivate you to really work at it and make the most of it  - if you put all your love for something into it it'll show and hte customers/fans/people will follow - believe in you.
