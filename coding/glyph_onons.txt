- initial thought:

triangles as per elec notation for amps, inc.:
>>VCAs, attens, invrts, attvrts, polar/isising VCAs, mixers(need to specify summin or unity)? if so then also xfaders, dynamics, comparators, mid-side coding, waveshapers/folders/distortions, sync gen, 

logic, analogue/digtal: digital needs 



squares for combo items such aa slopes and egs etc. that internally are a collection of comparators/vacs/mixers/trisource, matrices?
>>VCSs, EGs, VCFs, LPGs, LFOs, VCOs? fre shifter, 
- what are dc offset source listed as by this rule? tri for amp type i guess
what shape for delay family? digital/bbd/tapped delay's, phase, flange, comb filt/tl0


didgital modules:
gates, flipflops, switches, etc. dt_switch is naanalogue logi, seyencers#
cock dividers, mults tc.
note: penta can be comparator schmitt by setting to step or 2step and 0/5/0/5 etc.,


feedback-wrapaound looping arrow for self patchable?


signal representationsat all? if so - offset, cv, audi, gate, trig, clock, .


reprasent:
schmitt symbold fo some dort of shape gonaa be needed
technically needs vc/non vc [do w make any non-vc crud?]
will need way of implying variable slopes cos daisy chaining 3xVCA goes from linear to expo to wait...
internly normalled for some convenience?
>>analogue
digital/analogue logic
>>digital
buff_outs
>>audio
>>cv
audio rate mod possible, ultrasonic mod possible - [linketty cos wtf?: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_effect (accessed 230923 2318)]
lin/expo/higher order, log, 1V/oct
patch programmable symbol or just ref elswhere as whool set okf missing turtles?
+/- voltage range given as Vpp?
will saturate/clip/distort/overdrive - use general waveshaper symbol?
vactrol symbol? general opto symbol?
dual/quad symbol
dt_switch is naanalogue logic
will need logoc symbols and way to show anlo/digi capablity


c


 CA laims invertor on NAND will work for compressor but surely is digital only?
ptodist ssays  total frq controlable range 0 - 50khz but  due vctrols i doubt is exactly true - iirc due slew time of vactrols it ont go massively above maybe 16-17khz?
