Exploring the Universe in Empyrion: Galactic Survival – A Game Review
If you've ever wanted a blend of sci-fi exploration, survival mechanics, and limitless sandbox possibilities, Empyrion: Galactic Survival might just be the game you’re looking for. This game combines elements of open-world survival with the thrill of space exploration, crafting, and building, all set within a galaxy of planets, stations, and derelict ships waiting to be explored.

Here's a breakdown of what makes Empyrion unique, the challenges you’ll face, and some tips on getting started.

What is Empyrion: Galactic Survival?
Empyrion is a space survival sandbox game with a sci-fi twist. You start stranded on an alien planet, and from there, the galaxy is yours to explore, conquer, or simply survive in. The gameplay ranges from gathering resources and managing your character’s needs to building massive space stations, piloting spacecraft, and facing off against hostile alien factions.

The game’s primary focus is on survival and exploration. You have to manage hunger, oxygen, temperature, and health, which adds a layer of realism and challenge to your journey across different environments. And if that wasn’t enough, you’re also tasked with building your own tools, ships, and bases from scratch, all while fending off aggressive wildlife, enemy NPCs, and other challenges that await in the depths of space.

Core Gameplay Elements
Empyrion combines elements from a variety of genres to create a unique gameplay experience. Here are some of the game’s core components:

Survival Mechanics: Empyrion doesn’t just give you a vast galaxy to explore—it demands that you survive within it. You’ll need to manage your health, food, and oxygen levels, which can be challenging on planets with toxic atmospheres or extreme weather. The game’s attention to survival adds a constant sense of urgency, particularly in the early game, where you’re still scrambling for basic resources.

Resource Gathering and Crafting: Crafting and resource management are key to progression in Empyrion. You start with basic tools but will soon find yourself gathering minerals, salvaging wrecks, and mining asteroids to acquire rare resources. These materials allow you to craft better equipment, more durable bases, and advanced spaceships.

Building and Customization: Building is one of Empyrion’s biggest strengths. From basic survival shelters to massive space stations and warships, the game lets you construct almost anything you can imagine. The in-game building tools are highly customizable, allowing you to design every aspect of your base or vehicle.

Exploration and Space Travel: The galaxy of Empyrion is vast, with each planet offering unique resources, biomes, and challenges. You can seamlessly travel between planets and space stations, each of which has its own gravitational forces, atmospheric compositions, and weather patterns. This diversity encourages players to adapt their equipment and strategies for each environment they encounter.

Combat and Faction Warfare: Empyrion features a range of alien species and factions that you can choose to ally with or oppose. Combat is both on foot and in space, as you fend off hostile creatures, drones, and rival factions. The faction system adds a layer of strategy, as your choices can impact your standing with different groups and unlock unique resources or rewards.

Getting Started: Tips for New Players
Prioritize Survival Essentials First: At the beginning of the game, focus on gathering basic resources like food, oxygen, and fuel. Find a safe area to establish a basic shelter, and start small. There’s a lot to explore, but survival essentials should come first.

Learn the Crafting System: Familiarize yourself with the crafting system early on. This will make it easier to gather resources efficiently and avoid running out of essential items. Make sure you have a portable constructor for crafting essential items on the go, and upgrade your equipment whenever possible.

Scout and Explore: Don’t be afraid to explore your surroundings to locate useful resources or discover new locations. Just be mindful of your environment—you don’t want to stray too far from your base without a way to get back or survive harsh weather conditions.

Master Base Building: Building a sturdy base is essential for long-term survival. A well-protected base not only keeps you safe from hostile creatures but also serves as a hub for crafting, storage, and resource management. Start small and expand as you gather more resources and technology.

Upgrade to Space Travel: One of the most exciting aspects of Empyrion is exploring new planets and space stations. As soon as you’re able, upgrade your equipment for space travel. Your first spaceship might be a humble craft, but it opens up the galaxy and allows you to discover new resources, allies, and challenges.

Advanced Strategies for Space Survival
Once you’ve mastered the basics, Empyrion offers a wealth of advanced mechanics to explore. Here are a few tips for those ready to take on greater challenges:

Experiment with Building Blueprints: The game allows players to share blueprints of their creations, so if you’re not a natural builder, you can download designs from other players or upload your own to show off.

Develop Specialized Ships: Different missions call for different ship designs. Create specialized vessels for combat, mining, and exploration to make the most of your resources and protect yourself in hostile areas.

Explore Faction Diplomacy: Interacting with factions isn’t just about combat. Consider forging alliances to gain access to special resources, technologies, and missions. But be careful—aligning with one faction might make enemies out of another.

Customize Weapons and Defenses: As you progress, you’ll encounter more dangerous enemies. Make sure to upgrade your weapons, defenses, and vehicles regularly. Shield generators, upgraded turrets, and more advanced weapons can make a significant difference in combat scenarios.

Final Thoughts
Empyrion: Galactic Survival is a game that rewards creativity, strategy, and adaptability. Whether you're building a fortress on a hostile alien world or cruising through space in your custom-designed ship, Empyrion offers endless possibilities. It’s a challenging game, but one that offers immense satisfaction as you progress and overcome the many obstacles in your path.

If you're ready for a deep, rewarding, and endlessly customizable space survival experience, Empyrion: Galactic Survival might just be the perfect game to sink your time into. So, gather your resources, strap in, and get ready for an adventure across the stars!

Original base:
- mountain top, glass picture window overlooks a landscape reminiscent of Tuscany but with the addition of termite mounds taller than the poplar trees, spires towering into the sky dotted amongst forests, green rolling hills and silhouetted beautifully against the sunrise it catches each day.
- entrance is a tunnel, pic win is atop a cliff - when the alarm sounds I’m ready facing the tunnel with gun loaded. Red guys laser a hole in the pic win and shoot me in the back…

Building monorail to serve the greenhouse, distillery, tissue cultuplant:
- although a few mishaps with structural integrity of stations and track sections, the actual monorail construction takes a few weeks but is fairly incident free, building of high peak radio mast, tourist centre lower peak, talon fishing village replica, underground station with secret spy coms base and smugglers den, fort sanctuary, woflspire luxury mountain retreat and seaside luxury lodge all perfect.

-------------------------
sunrise over my monorails most nothern stop - tribal fishing village 

another luxury wofl retreat - the woflspire is served by the southern most stop on the monorail, an underground station buried deep in the mountain
the monorail from plat north to planet south as it vanishes into a hill

when you conquer the planet... its time for space 

every one of those stars you can warp jump to, visit planets, moons and asteroids, colonise/fight other races, trade, mine, farm, and run missions

the wofitol ship docked at the woflaestus spaceport in geostationary orbit above the north pole - the mountains visible next to the smol ocean are where the monorail terminates at the fishing village

wofitol ship is my exploration and invasion vessel and home awa from home all in one - hangar for smol ships with repair bay, hydroponic food farming, 36 retractable turret mounted lasers/homing missiles/plasma cannon/rail guns/artillery/gattling guns/flak cannon.
it even dwarfs the spaceport
it can travel between stars

finally of my huge collection of smol ships, my fav - its ugly, has a silly paint job but its faaaaaaasssssttt
--------------------------


- then red guys build a bass slap bang next to a track section - we artillery it to oblivion. They drop in assembly yards from space using huge capitol ships like sky cranes. We take em out. They get real mad and send a drone swarm - the sky turns black and anti-aircraft turrets eventually take em all out. Aftermath is a floor carpeted with smoking drone husks. This leads to mad wofl so I take out the orbital shipyard constructing the drones, all planetary bases and defences and generally killem once and for all - or did i? Nope - spaceport, supply depot, defence bases etc all respawn. E she’ll em outta existence yet again as a training exercise and fun for the newer addition to group.

Plateau planetoid mountainside luxury view home:
- originally had two turrets mounted on roof and nothing else in the way of defence mechanisms. After the first seemingly smol drone attack there were a lot of broken windows, one destroyed turret, much dented and destroyed upper blocks and significant issues clearly. Installed retractable turrets and more of em on roof, plus built a ship dedicated to this base with six rail guns, 4 uv lasers and one tot kill a couple the drone spawning bases.
- first base, nose shot clean off ship by rockets and plasma, crash-landed in snow and was thrown completely clear, landed in deep snow with no injury. Walked home, built another ship, flew back and retrieved original ship by installing temp cockpit and flying it rather weirdly home.installed a smol protrusion halfway up hangar to allow 2 ships to be docked at once.
- improved both ships to 8 rail guns and beefed up shape aerodynamic and paint jobs. Also took another attack by drone, with less damage but decided enough was enough and installed more retractable turrets and a shield - significant underground construction for fuel tanks, generators, pentad tanks, shield, solar power, capacitors etc.
- base now entirely self sufficient, needs only water

Teleports to new green pretty planet to build anther picture window base:
- Teleport crashes midway, emerges in a forest, utterly lost with no teleports or warp capable ship. Climbs one of the few visible high ground plateau’s in the near flat world of plains, lakes, woodlands and deserts. Incredible 260deg panorama view - good spot for a base. Up it goes so can install a teleports and get home.
- gets way too stuck into building new base, days pass and its becoming a major new installation along with a sub-space radio tower communication array spread across neighbouring plateaux. Upon installation of first radio tower is troop drop ship attack - I try to shoot down the ship before the guys disembark but the retractable minions dont emerge and it just leaves after I empty maybe 5 magazines of scout rifle into it. Unbeknownst to me the dropship has already unloaded its troops a half mile away previously and they are now blowing a hole in the wall of the radio mast base to replace the core - the radio mast is a separate base so the main base defences weren’t triggered. Oops.
- I recapture the tower, using a gatling laser, replace the core, rebuild the removed solar panels and install turrets for this as well as ammo box, xtra power, visible lights and more. Barely in time - more attacks, but successfully fought off. Realising all the radio towers are vulnerable this way I need to visit each one and install turrets, ammo, power etc. unfortunately, upon rising first tower to do this, I trigger an attack and barely get one turret set up - lucky scout rifle helps me n the lone turret win. Only 3 more radio towers to go and all is safe…
