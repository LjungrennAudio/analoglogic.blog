i just explained to someone who wanted to be a module designer how one single circuit can be used to make every single analogue module in the entire regular functional world.

then that the inner workings were quite simple, requiring 'just a few logic and core components - maybe 5 total'

...and then added that you can assemble that self same single circuit set of 5 or so components using  5 x the original simple circuit with slightly dif connections routed between them.
