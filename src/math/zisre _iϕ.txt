This animation illustrates a complex exponential 
𝑧
=
𝑟
𝑒
𝑖
𝜙
z=re 
iϕ
 , where the real and imaginary components rotate around a circle with radius 
𝑟
r over time. This results in a circular motion that can be decomposed into the real and imaginary components, which correspond to sinusoidal oscillations in the 
𝑥
x- and 
𝑦
y-directions. Here's a breakdown of the mathematical concept and how to reproduce a similar animation using JavaScript and HTML Canvas.

Understanding the Complex Exponential Representation
Complex Number:

𝑧
=
𝑥
+
𝑖
𝑦
=
𝑟
(
cos
⁡
𝜙
+
𝑖
sin
⁡
𝜙
)
z=x+iy=r(cosϕ+isinϕ)
Here, 
𝑧
z is represented as a point in the complex plane with:
𝑥
=
𝑟
cos
⁡
𝜙
x=rcosϕ as the real part (horizontal axis),
𝑦
=
𝑟
sin
⁡
𝜙
y=rsinϕ as the imaginary part (vertical axis).
Time Dependence:

The angle 
𝜙
ϕ is defined as 
𝜙
=
𝜔
𝑡
ϕ=ωt, where 
𝜔
ω is the angular frequency and 
𝑡
t is time.
This causes the point 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
(x,y) to rotate around the origin as time progresses, creating circular motion in the complex plane.
Decomposition of Motion:

The motion in the 
𝑥
x- and 
𝑦
y-directions can be viewed as independent sinusoidal oscillations.
The complete motion can be visualized as a projection onto the 
𝑡
t-axis, showing how the point traces a circular path over time.
Creating a Similar Animation in JavaScript
We'll use JavaScript and the HTML5 <canvas> element to animate this motion. The code below simulates a rotating point in the complex plane, illustrating the relationship between the complex exponential and circular motion.

Explanation of the Code
Canvas Setup:

We create an HTML5 <canvas> element to draw our animation.
centerX and centerY represent the center of the circular path, and radius determines the size of the circle.
Drawing the Circle:

We draw a static circle centered at centerX, centerY with the specified radius to represent the path of motion.
Calculating Position:

The x-coordinate of the moving point is given by 
𝑥
=
𝑟
cos
⁡
(
𝜔
𝑡
)
x=rcos(ωt).
The y-coordinate is given by 
𝑦
=
𝑟
sin
⁡
(
𝜔
𝑡
)
y=rsin(ωt).
Here, frequency serves as 
𝜔
ω, and time increases in each frame to animate the rotation.
Drawing the Radius Line and Point:

A line from the origin of the circle to the point 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
(x,y) represents the radius.
A small circle at 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
(x,y) represents the point on the circumference, moving along the circular path.
Projections on the Axes:

Dashed lines show the projections of the moving point on the 
𝑥
x- and 
𝑦
y-axes, illustrating the sinusoidal components.
These projections correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the complex exponential.
Animation Loop:

requestAnimationFrame(draw) keeps the animation smooth by redrawing at the refresh rate of the screen.
Each frame increments time, causing the angle 
𝜙
ϕ (and thus the position) to change.
Concept Recap
This visualization provides an intuitive look at how complex exponentials work:

Circular Motion: The complex exponential 
𝑧
=
𝑟
𝑒
𝑖
𝜙
z=re 
iϕ
  represents rotation in the complex plane.
Real and Imaginary Components: The x- and y-coordinates trace out sinusoidal functions over time, showing how the complex exponential can be decomposed into cosine and sine waves.
Applications: This concept underlies many areas in physics and engineering, especially in signal processing where sine and cosine components are essential for representing oscillations.
This interactive approach not only demonstrates the mechanics of complex exponentials but also allows for experimentation with parameters like frequency to see how it affects the rotation speed and waveform.
