waxcide/Thomas wulfe/buffaLOFIsh: Studio Production Works

DISASTER!!! My studio pc has died and I may have to wait uptown a month or more before I can afford to fix it leaving me unable to produce or work with the modular gear very easily. So in the mean time I am reduced to working on my attempts to develop a more professional musical identity via engaging an expert to help me create a social networking presence and so Iâ€™m sitting here writing blog posts, Facebook updates, instagram posts, uploading YouTube content to my new you tube channel and the like.

UPDATE!!! New parts failed to fix the problem - in rage, panic, stress, sorrow and utter fail i just bought a used replacement pc tower from ebay - it arrives today according to tracking due to some spectacular efforts in efficient shipping and hopefully there will be no damage; leaving me to install my extra ssd, upgrade ram and other components whilst praying to god i dont kill it in the process.

if all goes to plan i'll have an amd4Ghz 8 core, 8 thread, 32GbRam, 2 x 256 Gb ssd, 1Tb hdd twin 4k widescreen display 4Ghz GFX running ableton with some beefy sample packs and plugins - so excited!
