Lockstep design process continued...

Technically some of the stuff discussed so far was done a few years back as a proposed RYO module but abandoned as not suitable for a profit driven business. As a learning process though, it is ideal, so when a chance came to involve som people who could actually contribute useful input and would be enthusiatic and inspired by it as well as truly benefit it was a perfect moment to open the floor. as a result this caused the developemnt process to return to the more advanced parts of the basic design phase and good thing it did because there was still much to be done:

PART 3: DETAILED DESIGN AND FINALISATION PRE-PROTOTYPING

having shown the current proposed idea schematics it was time to start discussing everything that could possibly be thought of prior to breadboarding  - this wiould allow a full BOM to be made for ordering breadboard/prototyping parts and agree on any undecided issues that would require changes or experimentation.

- how big should the modules be - therefore dictating whethere minipots would be used [decision was minipots too frail and wobbly, as well as resulting in finger-cramping poor ergonomy].
- how many/where/what colour leds should be used to indicate any inputs, outputs, delay times, gate lengths etc [decided on input signal present led and output led that would show delay presence as well as gate length].
- shouold the module generate its own 5V supply or derive it from the busboard [decided to include internal 5v gen so those with no 5v bus presence wouldnt be inconvenienced]
- testing of delay ad gate length ranges are good - what size caps would be best ][decided also to consider a switchable cap choice so each delay/length channel could have range switches]
- are the 5v/10v suitable voltages for the output options [are they needed?if so what for?]
[Within the A-100 usually any voltage beyond about +3V is treated as "high" (e.g. +5V, +8V, +10V, +12V will work) and will trigger an ADSR or any other module with a Gate or Clock input (e.g. trigger delay, sequencer, clock divider, clock sequencer).] from 0 V to +8 V for ADSRs; Trigger, Gate or Clock Signals typical voltage levels of 0/+5 V.
- a database of known clock/gate/trig issues that are due to reset/clock/midi issues is def a good idea, i.e. note voltage/spikes/slew/gnd issues to help those who might think they need this module but it wont help,
can post soltuions given in forums to save people time - that'll make us popular as a rource and goto info source on clocks etc - to go in the back of the manual perhaps?
- Who was gonna do the breadboarding/CAD translation to get the experience under their belt and therefore plan discussions of talk through the early schems and familiarise others with the necessary info.

its also worth mentioning that some of this process is eased by prior experience from being part of a commercial industry designer - i specifically design to use as smol a number of component values as possible so that
a) it's less complex a build
b) it's less complex kit to pack, check and therefore avoid mistakes etc.
c) it costs less when bulk ordering components from factories in mass production [one change ina resistor value could change the bom cost by hundreds or even thousands on major scale]
d) tolerances of components have less overall effect because they tend to balance out when there's lots at the same tolerance
e) - it's easier for humans to build [finding the right component takes ess time the less dif ones there is] - it's easier for production pnp machines - cheaper the less reels have to be changed or the less different ones you use
f) shipping requires less packaging from component source and kit packaging needs less bags etc.
g) there's less colour codes etc for a beginner to learn
h) speeds up and reduces risk of placing a wrong value component the simpler you keep it
[ok thats all the reasons i can think of for now but i'm sure there's more]
as you can see, therefore there's a good chance you may find some things can be easily built of existing parts you have - some r, c and d values/types are ridiculously common in all electronics - way more than most others, fundamentally though there's always gonna be things you havent come across before or you dont have any of left because you only had one since they aint used much... 
also certain components just plain cant be substituted - for example although this design makes it possible to change values of resistors in the output buffers to get the same amplification using a number of different combos, it's not possible to substitute the 100uf electrolytic cap on the 5v power converter - that's just straight out strictly required according to the datasheet, and if you aint got one then you buyin one! [most of the components in this thing cost like 0.1c each, it's only pots and the power cable that are around the coupla $ mark]
