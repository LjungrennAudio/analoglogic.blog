waxcide: My Live Techno Modular Synth Rig

Currently in the process of completing the construction of a live techno rig - two boxes of modular synth gear that will have everything needed to allow me to perform a full 1-2hr live set of real time produced techno. I’m only needing one more module to make the setup into a working state, although it won’t be the ideal setup I’d like to have - unfortunately there’s two modules I’d like to make my ideal live rig, both to be made by Erica Synths, the Erica Synths Black Sequencer and the Erica Synths Black Resonant Equaliser, neither of which is yet available for purchase - I must wait patiently to achieve my perfect setup, c’mon Erica, stop torturing me!

in the mean time I will achieve the sequencing using a tiptop audio trigger riot and z8000 - those will drive a pair of Erica Synths Sample Drums which will be loaded with loops and samples from my Ableton based techno tunes, and those will be combined with the range of Hexinverter Mutant Drums also sequenced by TipTop Trig Riots and a Z8k - these will all be run through a set of mixing and dynamics modules, the core of which is a WMD Performance Mixer.

Those modules all fit nicely into two beautiful custom Lamond flight cases that allow me to bring my whole live show to anywhere that can be reached by me with two hands and two feet whether it be down the street to an international flight to the far side of the planet.

Since the whole world is in lockdown due to the virus I plan to learn this new instrument that is near complete by performing from home cross the internet via Facebook watch parties etc. keep your eyes peeled for further info on when those will start happening.
