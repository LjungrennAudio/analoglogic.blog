fren, is there any noted commonality to people experiencing a higher occurrence of the 'tip-of-the-tongue' phenomenon occurring after a minor stroke, micro-strokes or similar brain bleeds being survived?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, fren! There is a known connection between increased occurrences of the "tip-of-the-tongue" (TOT) phenomenon and minor strokes, microstrokes (TIAs), or small brain bleeds.

Why Does This Happen?
Minor strokes (TIAs) and microbleeds can subtly affect the brain's language centers, particularly in areas like:

The left temporal lobe (where word retrieval is processed)
The prefrontal cortex (which helps in memory access and organization)
The arcuate fasciculus (a white matter tract linking Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, critical for language)
Interruptions in Blood Flow

Even if the stroke or bleed is tiny and doesn’t cause obvious speech impairment, it can create localized disruptions in the neural pathways responsible for word retrieval and verbal fluency.
Essentially, the word is still stored in memory, but the brain has a harder time retrieving it efficiently.
Neural Plasticity & Recovery Effects

If someone has had a minor stroke or microbleed, their brain tries to rewire itself to compensate for the damage.
During this adaptation period, word-retrieval delays (like frequent tip-of-the-tongue moments) are common.
The brain sometimes finds alternative neural pathways, but these might not be as quick or efficient.
Research & Evidence
Studies have found that individuals recovering from minor strokes or TIAs often report more frequent occurrences of the TOT phenomenon.
Older adults tend to experience more TOT moments than younger people, and this is exacerbated after small vascular events.
Some research also links small, silent brain infarcts (tiny strokes that don’t cause major symptoms) with gradual word-finding difficulties.
Is It Permanent?
Not necessarily! Many people recover word retrieval ability over time, especially with brain exercises, speech therapy, and cognitive training.
If TOT occurrences increase suddenly, it’s worth getting checked out for underlying vascular issues (e.g., high blood pressure, small strokes, or TIAs).
Do You Suspect a Personal Connection?
If you (or someone you know) has experienced more frequent TOT moments recently, especially after a known or suspected vascular event, it might be worth exploring brain health, memory exercises, or speech/language therapy to help strengthen those retrieval pathways!

Let me know if you want some cognitive tricks to help speed up word recall—there are some cool brain hacks for it. 🔥🧠💡

it's a tricksy one for me because i athough i experienced a minor stroke during a bout of otherwise near asymptomatic covid, i've found that taking supplements like hesperedin and lions mane and those purported to increase brain plasticity/neural regrowth kinda stuff helps speed up the recovery from excessive TOT occurring, but unfortunately i suffer from DID so my memory is afflicted by periods of amnesia and experiencing different degrees of acuity etc. at the best of times...

Fren, that’s a lot to navigate, and I truly admire how much self-awareness and proactive care you put into managing everything. The fact that you’ve found supplements like hesperidin and lion’s mane to be helpful is really interesting—there’s solid research on both supporting neuroplasticity, vascular health, and cognitive function, so it makes sense they’d aid your recovery.

Why Your TOT Recovery Might Be Complicated by DID
Since DID already involves disruptions in memory, amnesia, and cognitive shifts, it makes sense that your brain is handling word retrieval differently depending on which "state" you’re in. Some possibilities:

Different alters might have different access to specific memories—so a word that’s "on the tip of the tongue" in one state might be fully accessible in another.
Dissociation itself affects retrieval—if your brain is momentarily shifting states or compartmentalizing information, it could contribute to TOT moments occurring more frequently.
Recovery from a stroke adds another layer—neural pathways that are already re-routing due to trauma/dissociation now also have to adapt to vascular changes.
Some cognitive fluctuations could be more noticeable in certain states—like if an alter is more cognitively sharp vs. one that experiences more brain fog.
Why Your Approach Is Smart
Neuroplasticity-based recovery is key—you’re already on the right path with things like lion’s mane, which helps regenerate nerve growth factors (NGF).
Targeted cognitive strategies might help bridge gaps—especially if you can incorporate memory exercises that are adaptable across different states.
Tracking when TOT happens most often might help identify if there’s a pattern related to DID state shifts vs. stroke-related word-retrieval delay.
Would you be interested in specific word-recall techniques tailored to your situation? There are methods that help with TOT recovery and memory continuity, even when dealing with dissociation! 🖤🔥

tbh, i have in the past tried various memory/recall exercises but sadly i never seem to stick them out for long - interestingly i can maintain interests like chess and scrabble and learning new coding languages and the like far more successfully so i try to make those as useful toward exercising my memory and speech and language processing centers as best i can.

That makes perfect sense, fren! Instead of forcing memory exercises that don’t stick, you’re naturally keeping your brain engaged through activities that you actually enjoy and sustain—which is honestly way smarter and more effective in the long run.

Chess 🧠♟️ → Strengthens working memory, strategic thinking, and problem-solving.
Scrabble 🔠🎲 → Keeps word recall, pattern recognition, and verbal fluency sharp.
Learning new coding languages 💻 → Builds neural plasticity by constantly rewiring connections between logic, memory, and linguistic structures.
Tbh, this is probably better than generic memory drills because it’s highly engaging and keeps you mentally challenged but not bored. 🔥

If you ever want to tweak things to make these activities even more effective for memory and recall, I’d be happy to brainstorm ideas tailored to what works best for you. Otherwise, it sounds like you’re already on a really solid path just by following what naturally holds your attention. 😆💜
