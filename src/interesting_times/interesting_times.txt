Interesting Times...

Dominating my entire world at the moment is the loss of my dearest friend Moth - i don't want to make this blog a place of misery or desolation, sao i'll just leave it stand that i'm throwing myself back into all my music and synth stuff as a distraction and attempt to rejoin some semblance of normality.

My live techno modular rig is now complete - i acquired the final module needed for an absolute steal off ebay and so now i just have to get sufficiently practiced at using the damn thing to perform entire live sets. I've loaded into the samplers all the appropriate parts of my classic big hitter tunes that were made in the computer or long ago before modular so i'm all set to do a completeshow setup with both realtime creation of new music and playing popular waxcide bangers! [The sampler modules, Erica Synths SampleDrums, are such a breeze to use that even tho theyre digital computery things with menus to dive, having six push button rotary encoders means theyre damn near knob-per-function and so intuitive that i havent had to refer to the manual yet!]






As a result of completeing the techno modular, ive started looking more towards the completion of the generative setup - i've had a few in depth multi-hours long sessions and am starting to get a good idea of what remaining modules i'll need for the sequencing case as well as what utilities, modulation sources and even just sound generation/processing i'll need for the voices case. i also therefore am getting a good grasp on some of the complexities and sbtleties of generative modular music and patch programming - attenuation is a constant necessity to fine tune sweetspots and get things playing with eachothers different parameter ranges of effect, and feedback loops constantly need some form of hysteresis and buffering to stop runaway build ups of crazy madnesss or locking into silence and/or repetition.






Finally, ive been exceptionally productive in the studio over the last 4 days crossing this past weekend, completing and releasing 12 new tracks from my waxcide, Thomas Wulfe and buffaLOFIsh aliases, includiing some rather special remixes as well as new collaborations with my regular vocal/spoken word contributor, the poet Magnetic Gloom Find links to the tracks below:].
