DNSK: DJ and occasional producer

I am a small town boy, born in the Land of Swedes in 1982 in Uppsala. I have been spinning them decks since 1994, and my base is right there – the 90s house scene – where I built my identity as a DJ and performer alike. Nowadays I produce DJ mixes, mashups and audiovisual videos. I really hope you enjoy my output, as music is love, music is life." - Daniel 'DNSK' Asplund.

The waxcide collective:

Together we form part of a collective of musicians, writers, poets and artists - graphic, CAD assisted and skilled freehand; the waxcide collective believes music and other arts should be free for the enjoyment of all and encourages practices such as musical sampling in order to create new works from existing sounds and creations - everything should be enjoyed to its full extent and creativity should know no bounds!
