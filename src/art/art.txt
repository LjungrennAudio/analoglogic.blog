A Two Part Artpiece (overdue).

this is actually a detailed, accurate and quite succinct representation of the concept surrounding the core of my recent psychosis. i'll explain no more than that so you can stare into the chasm and see if it screams back...

this an actual real screen shot of the note i left the one a single only time i've ever actually tried to kill myself. pls note:
i) i was quite calm, happy and working with conviction/motivation and not angry or upset or distressed really.
ii) it's dated file created 10th Nov 2023 - only a coupla months ago...
