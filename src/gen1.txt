waxcide/Thomas Wulfe: The Generative Sequencing Installation Art

Whilst I learn to use the live waxcide techno rig and develop my skills online, I also am filling that time by developing a second project - my modular installation art piece: an entirely independent from human control machine that can produce music involving melodies, baselines, harmonically complete musical works, based upon mathematical concepts such as chaos theory, fractal geometry and more - not just random mess, but a series of recognisable themes, patterns and structures that make tunes gradually evolving from one to another with infinite scope - able to run for ever without human intervention.

there is scope to wire this machine up to my live techno rig and other modular gear I own to make an even more spectacular art piece or even a machine that can perform a live techno gig without a producer or dj in sight! This is currently at least a year off in terms of construction time and me learning to ‘program’ it but the project is proceeding at a steady pace.
