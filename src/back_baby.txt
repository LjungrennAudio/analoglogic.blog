I'm Back Baby!

Yes, lat week i finished setting up the new studio computer, rebuilt the rest of the studio and thoroughly tested everything - and then proceeded to immediately produce a new waxcide tune - a rather weird piece of house music sprang from nowhere!

The new computer is not only fast enough to handle everything i could throw at it (the most complex project i had saved only took 25% cpu load and there was no lag in anayway) but also the machine is super quiet -barely a whisper from the fan when under load.

Now i have everything i need to produce music in all my aliases whther the sample and plugin heavy buffaLOFIsh lofi, complex realtime modular works using the machine like a multi-track tape recorder or ram intensive sampler based Thomas Wulfe works. Also the machine is adeptly capable of handling all my video editing for youtube uploads, social networking graphics/text stuff and CAD/spreadsheet work for RYO so i got all bases covered! yay!
