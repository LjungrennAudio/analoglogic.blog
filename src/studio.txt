Been Busy In The Studio - Multiple New Tunes!

Yup, taking breaks from setting up RYO and whilst i wait for cash to complete my live rig i've been up to all sorts:

Processed all the necessary files for to put my waxcide loops into the right format for erica sample drum sd cards and loaded em up - yet another little step closer to live show readiness;

Installed the Z8K cv sequencer to the mixing/dynamics/eq case and hooked it up to the sampledrums to test out cving up to a total of 6 assignable parameters at nce - those things are so intuitive to use and quick due to the six [yes, six] endless rotaries with push button action;

and, the purpose of this entry:

no less than 4 tunes from the waxcide collective in one week - one representing each alias i currently release under;

This first one is a particular treat - featuring spoken word vocals thanks to the talents of Magnetic Gloom, someone who i have been wanting to work with ever since hearing hr recite one of her works on soundcloud which i only heard a number of _years_ after meeting her and not knowing she had hidden skills!





The wonders of using Magnetic Glooms vocals in waxcide techy/housey music - effectively an insdtrumental, but the vocals form the core samples it's based around:





I heard a wonderful excerpt from an episode of Playschool a coupla months back whilst the studio computer was borkened and i set the audio aside to work on when i got the machine back online - and finally this fell out - random as hell and jus 2hrs this very afternoon!





And finally, something i been itching to sample for yars - and still feeling musical after finishing the buffaLOFIsh track i embarked upon it just to at least get started - and ended up finishing the second tune in 6hrs total time of one day - this great day!





Enjoy!
