That's the sound the Narcan Van makes

It's driven by the narcan man

And his trusty sidekick the nod-out kid

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 16:51

the narcan man can ðŸŽµÂ 

gils â€” Yesterday at 16:53

a very dystopian short story just played out in my head hah

the narcan man in his narcan van

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 16:58

like an ice cream van

when you hear the music you get high cos you ok to od

ðŸ˜’

***gils is typing lots...

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:00

his life is short and hard because he made deals with god and the devil for all the souls he keeps out of their hands

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:01

whoa - you takin this way further than me

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:01

told you, short story played out right in my head

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:01

does he live in a castle made of used biohazard syringe waste?

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:02

if i had more motivation i might write it, but it would be a poor mashup of ideas i've gotten from elsewhere no doubt

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:02

so

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:02

no he lives in his van

never sleeps

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:02

thats how creativity works

you resynthesise from previous unfinished scraps until you cobble together something good enough to release

where does he store the souls?

does he have a thing like the ghostbuster vacuum cleaner trap

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:03

he doesn't

he saves people

only in the end

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:03

not everyone lives

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:04

he gets to keep one

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:04

and he gets punched alot

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:04

and it becomes his soul

he cannot know if will go to heaven or to hell

before he makes his choiceÂ 

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:04

he needs a capture device for the souls, especially if he rotates as he finds better and better ones

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:05

the narcan man tries to keep souls in their bodies

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:05

this encourages him to fid good people, get em addicted and then save themÂ 

til one dies despite his efforts

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:05

he doesn't want them on his hands

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:06

wonder if the'll let us have gene wilder back a while to record the theme song

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:06

lol jesus, no

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:06

btut

but

but

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:07

my story is just sad. yours is bordering evil

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:07

but i'm better at it

mine is more true to life

paralells can be drawn to reality

this makes myh work more valid

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:08

mine's not meant to be real

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:08

allegory

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:08

more or less

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:09

see - the paralleslls drawn from mine allegorically says the better a person you are the more reason to avoid getting addicted to hardcore drugs or other vices

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:10

an empty man, rejecting chance after chance to snatch a soul and fill his void

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:10

the book of wofl; wofl c.1983

a man seeking to ever improveh chance of avoiding hell

regardless of those who plummet down below him to save him

gils â€” Yesterday at 17:12

he knows the devil. and his existence isn't exactly pleasant to begin with. heaven and god have their problems

full of f*****g win â€” Yesterday at 17:12

gods way more efucked .

gils â€” Today at 17:12
lol it's very.... Gaiman-verse/Preacher

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:13
all powerful yet allows evil to exist
allows hunger, anger, pain, sorro, torment, fear

gils â€” Today at 17:13
why do you think the narcan man carries on so

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:14
he's morally sound?

gils â€” Today at 17:14
he's blind to his final choice, just like the rest of us (edited)

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:14
ha
he's a product of the gulf between fucked up god and simple straight laced devil
devil is wysiwyg (edited)

gils â€” Today at 17:14
indeed
everyone can taste hell, the devil gives it away for free

gils â€” Today at 17:16
peter at the gates, heaven remains a mystery. god is not so generous

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:16
but peter is a fun guy - he has a big table awaiting yo, upon it is a mountain of every drug you ever took

gils â€” Today at 17:17
peter is not what you expect

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:17
and next to it is a smoller table with all the crap you carpet surfed that wasnt drugs

gils â€” Today at 17:17
i've not populated him fully yet
he's a minor character
but he's extremely f*****g weird

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:17
and there is a tv playing your 'greatest hits' - moments ike when you dropped your coke can, caught it without spilling a drop but no-one sawl

gils â€” today at 17:18
no drugs, no tv. it's not even a fancy gate.

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:18
he's more liek a cheesygame show host

gils â€” Today at 17:18
peter's kind of tired, tbh
he can relate to the narcan man
living in the space between

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:19
naw - peter loves his job, having the power to choose who goes upo n who. goes down
all based on arbitrary rules

gils â€” Today at 17:20
eh that was a lie. peter has no real agency

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:20
a prize that always turns out to be ironic and weak

gils â€” Today at 17:20
he's just the bouncer. he keeps the rabble that want in, out.
and he disagrees with god plenty

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:21
def

gils â€” Today at 17:21
but has no agency to not open the gate

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:21
what about bad peeople

gils â€” Today at 17:21
he doesn't have to deal with the mess of live humans, so he doesn't push his luck
but he's not a fan of his job anymore

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:22
hmmmm

full of f*****g win
what about bad peeople

gils â€” Today at 17:22
well, what else would he disagree with god about?

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:22
i dont buy it
power corrupts
even illusury power

gils â€” Today at 17:22
in this world peter has no real power

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:22
noone does

gils â€” Today at 17:22
moreover...
peter's never seen beyond the gates either

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:23
after all - the narcan man is a solipsist (edited)

gils â€” Today at 17:23
and it makes him pretty f*****g nutty

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:23
@.@

gils â€” Today at 17:23
the narcan man isn't a solipsist he doesn't even have his own soul

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:24
thbats why hes a solipsist
what else can he truly believe deep down

gils â€” Today at 17:24
he doesn't eat, he doesn't sleep

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:24
he doesnt need to
everything is in his imagination

gils â€” Today at 17:26
the only thing that sustains him are the shreds of memories, little disconnected pieces he collects from each person he saves
this is part of the deal he's made

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:27
i thinkn he lives on scaraps of emotion
his victims - saved and returning to the dull miserable lives they are trappped in
anger at losing theiur high they enter a rage of precipitated with drawl and break his nose for the bnillionth time
crying
staring down desopondently
trudging back to their places of rest

gils â€” Today at 17:29
now you're in the right world

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:29
i was in this world all along

gils â€” Today at 17:30
haha a choose your own adventure

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:30
can i blog his convo as a meta story
two people having a weird convo

gils â€” Today at 17:31
i'm actually thinking of copying a lot of this into text and see if i can clean it up a little
pass it on to ***** and see what he says. he'll tell me where i've stolen the ideas from lol

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:32

gils â€” Today at 17:33

it's a crappy mashup of american gods characters

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:33
you ok to just select the whole trhing top to bottom and fling to your fren?@

gils â€” Today at 17:34
ya prolly

full of f*****g win â€” Today at 17:34
dont let it vanish

[permission later given to publish conversation for comedic purposes as desired after gils prepared as a short story after consultation with ***** fren. Here it is for all to chuckle at - a battle of wits clearly dominated by gils but all in the spirit of two frens creating a fantastically creepsy character purely for funsâ€¦]
