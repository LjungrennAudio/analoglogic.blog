after latest update was significant change to smol ship physics - especially in atmosphere but also in outerspace

many ship that were awesome for purpose in previous builds suddenly became near unflyable

others werent affected due to changes not being relevant to purpose, and some became unhindered in anyway or in a coupla cases even improved.

sad losses to the wonderous lineup were the silver streak exploratory dropship - insanely fast stil so could cover massive amounts of ground surveying around planets and moons etc but unfortunately in atmosphere would practically fall out the sky when even the mildest iof manouvering was attempted. the dragster no longer benefited from crazy low drag due to lattice work bbeing treated as near zero drag, so suddenly needed way more manouvering engines which would change the entire build from scratch. the wofltonk troopship is now too heavy and bulky to serve as anything but a troop transporter between capitol ship/spacestation and planet surface, even though its armed to provide sufficient support for near any situation troops could possibly encounter.the wofl tie had become somewhat sluggish in atmosphere and lacked engine power to be fast or manouverable in atmosphere but as a bit of fun ofc it has to be retained in garage. finally, the woflsmggl became unstable and hard to handle, especialy at high velocity so needed some stabilising spoilers in atmosphere, and the chance to upgrade weapons, sheilds and rcs/cargo situation was taken. 

the woflcoptr heavy gunship remained a big lubering beast able to soak up damage whilst takig out near any target befre having to dodge so was p much unaffected, tho it still was only good for apache attack chopper style attacks, sneaking up to just in range under cover by flying low behind hills/forests, then using rail guns and homing missiles to take out ships/turrets before doing near as much damage as ann artillery piece to buildings and space structures prepping th way for foot troops to enter and place charges on the bases core.
likewise the woflminer proved unaffected having never been fast or agile as such in the first place - a space only vessel that bumbled around asteroids and collected ore like some weird beetle, it probably was dreadfully sluggish in atmosphere, but in space it could still cruise along just fine.

the b4llennium b4lcon was built after the physics changes and performs spectacularly, but is woefully underarmed and too large for 90~% of situations where it might prove useful - its basically an immense warp-drive mounted in as small a ship as can handle it - i.e. a smol vessle by class but certainly not smol and has to be docked outside the station rather than in the main hangar with the rest.

finally remains the two ships to benefit from the new physics: the waffen wofl beiong a big flying wing with great streamlining and aerodynamics, the wings giving lift in atmosphere and the lightweight carbon fibre/large engines for weight/size making it very capable with high speed cargo shhifting or taking ssingle persons between planetary atosphere destinations as well as planet to spacestation flights.its also sufficiently heavily armed to take out other ships although wouldnt stand a chance against big spacestations or groundbases with turrets.

last but absolutely by no means least we have the good ol SSFC. built in a previous version to be the fastsest possible 2 seat smol ship designable, it has proven not only to be even faster but also more manouverable, areodynamic and also capable of such fast liftoff / acceleration in all directions and axes of rotation that it is fit for pretty much any purpose imagineable. it consists of nothing but cockpits, engines a sheild and some weapons - and they are the biggest engines availble - dwarfing the twin cockpits, both the main forward thrusters and the reverse thrusters are so large that the damn thing does stand still to max velocity in atmosphere or sppace so quickly its like it just vanishes when an eye blinks. along with medium thruster pairs for all other directions and some surprisingly low drag design, the thing can act as dogfight supremo, rescue ship, smugling vessel, trading vessel for smol commodities like luxury goods and illegals, or transport/backup for missions f near any kind. its armed to the teeth with both turrets and fixed guns including homing missiles and rail guns so can cope with attack and defense in near all situations, its also well sheilded, armoured, long distance capable and well equipped with extra like scanner for exploring etc.

its near perfect handling and crazy fast response to controls p much spoil any pilot for their own ship after even one single flight.

fundamentally its p much the perfect smol ship in every way except perhaps aesthetics. as far as looks go, the obsidian hewn looming terror that is the  woflcoptr remains my fav, closely followed by the sleek lines of the woflsmggl as the  sexy sleek fighter look goes.

more recently than my first draft of this blog post, i built a ship based on near exactly the same engine config as the ssfc, but with an aitight cabin instead of cockpits - then covered it in a layer of combat steel and beefed up sheilds at cost of reduced attack weaponry - its now an emergency rescue bugout dropsip, capable of dropping from a capitol ship and piercing the atmposphere in seconds to grab upto 2 passengers in trouble, take major flak whilst doing so and then gtfo fast as hell whilst holding its own defensively. its heavier and somewhat less manouverable in atmosphere than ssfc but has waaaaay more vertical lift off so can deal with even the crasiest of hi g planets n moons

also new is the zirax destroyer - a fighter style single cockpit ship thats basically a vehicle for 8 railguns and little else - it relies on its complex wing structure to provide lift when going fast forwards so isnt ideal for close support - its more of a fast dive, destroy and loop back for more runs kinda ship - a strafer. its great fun to fly tho, handling liek a 1990s us navy jet fighter - great at barrel rolls and fast bankin turns etc

the lesson to be drawn from all this is, if you want to do real damage or be real fast, youre gonna have to sacrifice p much every other consideration - you'll need very big engnes to carry weight whether it be 8 rail guns plus homing missiles or multiple passengers and heavy armour - either way you need some serious push to move that mass in atmosphere and so the only ships even getting away with smol thrusters and hence smol size are just a cockpit and a coupla lasers - no shields, armour, passengers or warp.

design your ships to a specific need and dont compromise - they may be ugly quite often bu they'll perform well
