...leading convo drifts across topics inluding tropical alpen from the 80s, topical alpen for open wounds/muller rice for other wound treatment, weirdest possible subjects for a deepfake reincarnation [clearly cilla black...], and we land here:


```
oh - a lora is a way of shortcutting traing stablediffusion 'on-the-spot' s it were - i.e. you can just refer it to a jsson and it will auto load say 'cillablack' and know what her face/body/whtever looks like...
there are other models as well as loras but theyre the easist to pretrain/get into as a beginner

i'm using it as my start point into  building up to having a local running llm and then even ustom datasets etc.
the longterm goal is an llm specifically trained for music/emotion content

so instead of image gen or code assist or conversational chat, you feed it a playlist and itll listen through it and output suggestions from, e.g. spotify or w/e banks to gib recommends

ideally eventually will be able to give it thumbs up/down or summin each tune hence refining the output dynamically realtime blah blah
it's a long road

maybe  i'll even somehow integrate into a vst3 plugin for ableton that generates chords n stuffwelp, currently learning loras is just teaching me about how traing/datasets/etc. works and how to choose dif numbers of epochs blah blah

welp, currently learning loras is just teaching me about how traing/datasets/etc. works and how to choose dif numbers of epochs blah blah

even after that i still got generalise outward/generalise outward again/abandon specificity to image gen/abandon specifcty to etc..
it's nota fast journey and you got time to jump on board and catchup  your own route
i just liked this route cos i had a private sidetwack interest
i got bored yesterday and wrote a python script that uses stablediffusions turbo sketch/control abilities to blend multiple imagesand generate new content based upon them:
it takes minimum 1 image of a  face and turns as many faces as given intoa new combo face
works well but i have some minor prompt issues
[simply the current output is always standig o a beach looking wet n salty]
üòÑ
that was cos 2 days ago i was doing a favour for milly who wanted to see quite how good i could make ai nudes of her  - unfortunately rtc's jailbreak had been closed up via the usual udge methods so i had to alter the jailbreak
hence i dug into actual api accessing python

by the time i'd finished, although i got reasonably reognizable graphic hardcore milly nudes, i was much more into the concept of how much of a raw data set of images it needed for input to be able to absolute anything...
reasoning that although technically you can just give one face shot and tweaktil it gets the face right, that's a lil like cutting out a face from a magazine and sticking it on random pr0n - borrrring
i wanted actual face regardless of angle, actual realistic boobs/pussy etc.
yes, ofc that requires source material but theoretically, if you have raw data theres a nice balance between having some real shots of everythig you wanna see from various angles andletting the power of 'ai' do the rest
turns out current  tech/what we can comfortably run on a home machine with a commonplace higher end nvidia card requires maybe as littlde as 50 pics and no more than 250 max to get uncannily real shots of chosen person even if never before have they stripped naked, arched their back and scuttled across the floor like a spider whilst dripping juices down inner thighs or w/e sick n  twisted shit the real crazies want...

if you dont care about having that persons actual legs/boobs/hands/pussy/ears/whatever is so easy it's ridiculous but if you wanna deepfake/video etc. this becomes much more necessary
as yo can see this is becoming faster and faster not just put millys face on a naked body but 'ohhh - so that's what it actually takes to do a real deepfake'
and it turns out, yes as of about 6 months to a yr or so ago an member of public can repro any voice whatsoever with just a few paragraphs of spoken word
and yes therefore a few years before gen pop there were peope who could theoreticall make convincing vids even
but it's harder, less advanced and much more work/limited results than you think and generally requires the kinda source material ou only get from people as public as celebrities or politicians etc.
i.e. if you've never been filmed butt naked from 25 angles and recorded speaking for approx.10-20mins with no other major noise isues etc. - welp, they aint making deep fakes, theyre just sticking a fair approx. of your face on someone elses bod and maybe getting as good your voice as a million comedians out there can


i.e. def not  fooling a bank voiceprint id or making hyperreal accurate vids of you naked from just your face n a fully clothed photo 
basically, short of taking this project back to where i'm interested i'm already done with that rabbithole, never worrying again and paying little heed to fools 
[beware: if youleav a ton of footage avail of you smoking meth/stripping nude when drunk/yelling nigger/whatever on discorb, and yes, it is all recorded - near any vc of 25 cams max  alowed i guarantee you an avg of 5 or so are recording the lot, welp - youre leaving yourself open even to joe bloggs with a std gaming pc and maybe a working weeks investment of time, to reproducing you doing any goddamn thing they please. you have been warned...]

[[my learning project
part a) is 'i have maybe 10gb plus of roxie vids n pics - can  make a roxie lora?'
part b) is 'oh look - access to sora - lets make the video equiv' (in future)
part c) is 'can i make something that lets me do 'i wanna mix of roxie n emily' or 'i want emily pssy but roxie tits'
that's end of curiosity for me]]
after this hopefully we a coupla yrs in and i have a server driving multiple machines with tensor cards ofsomesrt within a budget of $10-20k and can do the music thing...]]

Exploring AI, Deepfakes, and the Future of Personalized Music Curation
So, a recent conversation took me on a wild journey through a range of topics, from ‚Äô80s nostalgia about tropical-flavored Alpen to the strange potential of using deepfake technology on‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say some unconventional subjects. But in the end, we landed on something fascinating: using AI models to curate music based on emotional content. Here‚Äôs where the journey began, where it‚Äôs going, and how all this tech could shape the future of personalized music recommendations (and some other strange but fun detours along the way).

A Crash Course in Loras: Shortcutting AI Training
If you‚Äôre diving into AI and machine learning, you‚Äôll quickly stumble across something called a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). Essentially, LoRAs are a way to quickly customize models like Stable Diffusion, but without needing extensive and intensive training from scratch. Think of it as providing a set of shortcuts, allowing a model to understand specific visual or contextual features ‚Äì like recognizing a famous person‚Äôs face or style ‚Äì without needing an entire dataset of thousands of images.

For example, imagine telling an AI model to recognize ‚ÄúCilla Black‚Äù in any image or scene you feed it. With a well-trained LoRA, it would ‚Äúknow‚Äù her face, body language, and typical style cues ‚Äì all from just a relatively small amount of data. This shortcut training method is fantastic if you‚Äôre just starting in AI, as it allows you to train models faster and experiment with customization without dedicating months to dataset creation.

The Goal: Creating a Music-Curating LLM (Large Language Model)
My interest in LoRAs sparked the idea of building up to something even bigger: a Large Language Model (LLM) designed specifically for music curation based on emotional content. Imagine a model where, instead of generating images or code, you can feed it a playlist, and it will recommend similar tracks based on vibe, genre, or emotion. It‚Äôs not just about matching tempo or key ‚Äì this LLM would go deeper, suggesting tracks with similar emotional undertones.

The idea is that, over time, you could give the model feedback, like a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on each track, and it would adapt its recommendations accordingly. Ideally, I‚Äôd love to develop this as a plugin for something like Ableton ‚Äì so a producer could generate chord progressions, melodies, or even full song recommendations based on the mood or theme they‚Äôre working on. It‚Äôs a long-term project, but learning the basics of LoRA and Stable Diffusion is a good place to start.

Side Quest: Blending Faces and AI Deepfakes
Of course, while training my model, I had some fun along the way. I experimented with **Stable Diffusion‚Äôs

Exploring the Power of AI: From Face Merging to Custom AI Music Assistants
I recently found myself wandering through a fascinating tech rabbit hole, the kind where one minute you're looking up '80s nostalgia about Alpen cereals, and the next, you're diving deep into AI, deepfake technology, and dreamscapes of custom-built, music-inspired machine learning models. Bear with me‚Äîthis is a journey across a landscape of AI creativity, ethical musings, and a good dose of nerdy ambition.

LoRAs: A Shortcut into the World of AI Training
First, let‚Äôs talk about LoRAs. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a tool for training machine learning models, especially popular in the Stable Diffusion community. Essentially, it allows you to train a model on specific images or references without needing a huge dataset or extended training time. Think of it as a "cheat code" to load up custom, recognizable references (like ‚ÄúCilla Black‚Äôs face‚Äù if you‚Äôre feeling particularly niche). LoRAs simplify the training process, making it accessible even for beginners who want to dip their toes into AI.

My goal with LoRAs is a bit unconventional. I want to train an AI that doesn‚Äôt just recognize faces or images but can also interact with music. Imagine feeding a playlist into an AI, and it analyzes the vibe and suggests new tracks‚Äîkind of like a supercharged Spotify DJ, but tailored to my taste. In the long run, I‚Äôm aiming to create an AI music assistant that understands emotion, genre, and sonic texture and makes recommendations or even creates music on the spot. A lofty dream? Sure. But it all starts with understanding the basics, and LoRAs are my entry point.

Building Toward an AI-Powered Music Companion
This is where things start to get ambitious. After getting the hang of training with LoRAs, the idea is to move toward a local, custom large language model (LLM) that specializes in music and emotion analysis. Imagine an AI that could listen to your playlist, identify what you might like, and even generate new musical ideas or chord progressions. Maybe it would suggest ambient soundscapes for your morning coffee or syncopated beats for a late-night creative session.

To make it all happen, I'm setting up a development pipeline to experiment with different datasets, tweak training parameters (like the number of epochs), and slowly broaden the model‚Äôs understanding. Each step forward is a mini-milestone, moving from basic image recognition to something much broader, more flexible, and musically inclined.

Eventually, who knows? This AI could live as a VST plugin in Ableton, generating chords, riffs, or even entire compositions based on the mood you‚Äôre trying to set. Right now, though, I‚Äôm still figuring out how to make a LoRA recognize multiple images‚Äîbaby steps, but every bit counts!

Deepfake Detours: From Face Swaps to Realistic AI Reproductions
In the course of learning about LoRAs, I naturally wandered into the realm of deepfakes. Deepfake technology has become increasingly accessible, allowing people to generate realistic faces, voices, and even full-body movements based on surprisingly little data. Want a composite face generated from a blend of different features? Done. Want an AI model that can approximate someone‚Äôs voice with a few paragraphs of audio? Also done.

But as powerful as this technology is, it comes with limitations and ethical considerations. To achieve an authentic, truly convincing deepfake, you still need extensive source material‚Äîclear photos or recordings from multiple angles and with high fidelity. While the tech is evolving quickly, creating a perfect replica is still tough, especially if you only have a few snapshots to work with.

In experimenting, I built a Python script using Stable Diffusion‚Äôs control and sketch abilities to merge faces from multiple images. It‚Äôs effective, though sometimes my outputs still end up with unintended quirks (like standing on a beach in the rain‚ÄîAI can have a funny sense of creativity). And while this exercise started as a lighthearted exploration, it quickly became a lesson in understanding how much raw data and tuning go into making realistic deepfakes.

Ethics and Privacy in the AI World
The deeper you go into AI, the more you realize how important ethical considerations are. Deepfakes are a perfect example. It's relatively easy to superimpose someone‚Äôs face onto another image, but creating a genuinely convincing deepfake that would fool someone takes a significant amount of data and processing power. This isn‚Äôt an invitation for people to test the limits on privacy invasion, though. Just because the tech exists doesn‚Äôt mean it should be misused.

There‚Äôs a real difference between making a funny composite image and creating a video or audio that could be used maliciously. For now, the barrier to truly convincing deepfakes is high enough that most of us don‚Äôt need to worry about random strangers creating hyper-realistic fakes. But for anyone concerned, the best advice is to be cautious about what you put online. If you‚Äôre broadcasting every moment, it‚Äôs fair game for anyone to use.

The Ultimate Goal: A Tailored AI Music Assistant
Back to my original goal‚Äîcreating a custom AI for music. In the coming years, I‚Äôm hoping to build a dedicated setup with a server running multiple machines, powered by advanced graphics cards, and a modest budget of around $10-20k. With this setup, I could process complex datasets, train unique models, and really dive into custom AI applications.

I‚Äôm envisioning a future where I can ask my AI assistant to suggest chord progressions, generate mood-based playlists, or even analyze the emotional tone of my music. Imagine producing a track and having an AI fine-tune it based on real-time feedback or create accompanying visuals that match the vibe of the sound. It‚Äôs a big vision, and there‚Äôs a long road ahead, but each small experiment and project I work on‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs deepfake tech, image processing, or LoRAs‚Äîbrings me a step closer.

Wrapping It All Up
AI is a vast, complex field with endless possibilities, from creating composite images to generating music recommendations and beyond. As I continue down this road, learning everything from training processes to ethical considerations, I‚Äôm both excited and a bit daunted by the journey ahead. Who knows where this exploration will lead?

For now, though, I‚Äôm having fun with each experiment‚Äîtinkering with image processing, dreaming up future music applications, and learning the ins and outs of AI along the way. So if you‚Äôre interested in diving into AI, I‚Äôd say jump on board. Start small, maybe experiment with LoRAs or a Python script here and there, and see where the rabbit hole takes you. After all, the future is wide open‚Äîand who knows what amazing things we can create?
