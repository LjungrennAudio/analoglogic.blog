throughtout this info i refer to all situations where a source controls a destination pairing more traitionally referred to as 'master-slave' relationships as 'dom-sub' relationships, not so much out of political corrcetness or some 'white guilt', but more because in analogue synthesis and electronic configurations involving complex feedback loops etc., the true reality of who is actually dictating the terms of the relationship is more a nod to [dom]->[sub] and in fact a rich inteerplay of back n forth push-pull tha results in very similar subtle non-linearities that surprisigly well reflect some real world dom-sub relationships far better than any other analogy. in situatons of direct digital [a] dictates to [b] i might still label them 'master-slave' - why lie?

this jus reminded me that my trig rits are relabelled as dom-sub, but i had three then sold one - i wonder if i inadvertently sold either dom or sub and some lucky soul out there hasnt even noticed...
