info	?

design	learning


make font from the animal keybrat
come up with symblos for each module base on amth and animal font
use best indididual keys etc. for buttons on wesite.
geenral aethisc is obviuos in folder
colur pallette needs tbe perfected:
iprefer fade of pink, fade of ble, the majority white/dark ever so slightly blued gray for thee darks.
occassional highlighs of purple/yellow/orange.
in the colages not the rounded edgees -even that little makes huge dif.
softening -ttake it further - blur gently but not shadows. nicepage can auto do this consistently.
non shadows and stuff keeps it a lil 'not too real' - adds that cartoon comfort/simplicity.
subtley is key with stuff like fades etc, 

SIMPLICITY IS KEY WITH THIS PALETTE

i sat but i didn't listen. to this day, i sit  but i don't listen.
no matter what they do externally, in your own head you are free.


everything.
alll
did it myself [sanding on shoulders of gients, nothing new under sun etc. ...]:
font's crated  using: xxx
one inspired by a weird typeset somthing to do with cats seen on a photo i have inn archive drive - image capture etc. [thts the headings and glyphs etc. menuss blahlah
general readable type is concept f cross bewtween a fav o mine - the fontused for te kinda ms-dos code window genral as readable as it gets sans-serif computer green writing on black/v dark green screen, but with a touch of worn out type-writer thrown in and maybe a hint of rasnom note :P

and noww alles kamuffel. [gotta lookup what that means...]



in mspaint:

convert pic to 256 colour bitmap by doin g saveas, other formats from dropdown,
you can try 16bit but canes are youll lose soem f theniceer subtleties. monochrome is generally hopeless unless used for effect. can be god for extracting base points for real long winded work.

grow whole canves o a few times bigger:...

set 'select tool mode to 'transparent background'
eyedropper a nonblack [or nontext] colour with rmb to make that actve bckgrnd col.
select whole pic, sliiiiiiide to the right. sjuldleave behind grey/blue/whatever you slected and move all else
bucket fill tool, set primy colour to white[lmb] and fill th paych left behind so ou dont get in a mess.
rinse and repeat - usually takes maybe 6 or seven iteratins if  you chose a good source.boom - good qual, not too steppy etc. monochrome of your text.

there will be an teration when you los haf you text - probably it'll look lke blak but be v dark blue or something and is actualy the key part. unless there's any real problem patsleft this is time for stage 3.

[der buhold]

msphotos
ajustments ssettings: [the lil sun/darness glyph, rhs of thee at top]
it's usually as easy  as just setting 'clarity slider' max rhs. should turn to monochrome. if the baalnce of b/w isnt perfectly to you liking, try tweak the contrst up, shadws up, highlyights down with clarity at original zeroed mddle setting and then see how you fare.
i dont recmmed altering exposure as it weill either kill the white status of the white or it'll start to destroy the integrity of letter definitions, smoothness etc.
likewise, any colour changes,including not undr the colour box, 'tin' andwarmth will  likely be enturely unhelpful unless your whole pic is blue/red/green shifted or something.
finally, vignette _can_ be used successfully to whiten the paper area sometimes, but since by nature it introduces a gradient even at extreme 'inverse' [lhs, i.e. lightening] it generally introdues more crap than helps.


///// i used thes technques for making the simplified 'cartoon' modules on the website too - worked frm orignal photos, reducred colours/remoed colours/changed colours/thckned lines/eredid text with the font created as descrbed, and also alot of pixelart!


i davide to save as a png or something quickn smol tohandle cos bmps are cumbersome and you shouldnt lose anyquality or anything.

now

back to ms paint:

remembering to trun on transparent select[it defaults off, every single f%$Â£%ing time...]

cut out and orgnise with selesct tool the whoe set of alphabet/numbers/math/etc.
zoooming in to pixel level can help occasionally here.

if you need to resize anything, DO NO TRY USING THE HANDLES TO STRETCH/SHRINK the select box.
there is no keep proportional thing.
the 'resize' funtion on the toolbar, owever does have maintian aspect ration option by default on and cn do percentage or pixels.

once you got your full set of desirred glyphs, you'll need each glyph a sa sparate .bmp - prferablyy abut 300dpi min res.
yup,no two waysabout it -it's select, copypast to a new fil for each until yougt like 50 .bmp's each labeled with your font working name and theglyph name.

then you can assemble em into a font!

[you can use high-logic	scanahand:

to print character templatei you wanna use your hndwriting or draw stuff]


try running through inksacape or gimp and then filter guassian blur at 2 or 3 pixels.



no you'll want:

high-logic fontcreator



there'sa bit of an art to using fontcreator import image from file thingy:
- if you select either degree of smoothing thn it will apply it, immediate - ay ooming then zooms the soom=thed shape _not_ zooms then smoothes.
- the 2 filters are tricksy - making stuff fattr works better at high zoom and making things eroded thinner works bst a lower zooms.
- it doesnt really previs anything like as good as th results you get when it generates the glyph in the actual editor.
you can do a heckuvva lot in fontcreator glyph editing so you dont need to to do too much before hand.



made a test font - miht polish it and use on website

will also makethe glyphs or synth stuff to a unicode font maybe...



come up with suoer easy to differentiate intuitive glyphs for each common/basic and even other module functions, based on math preferably and do chart f modules with all the glyphs for each.
