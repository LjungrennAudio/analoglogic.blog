geenral aethisc is obviuos in folder
colur pallette needs tbe perfected:
iprefer fade of pink, fade of ble, the majority white/dark ever so slightly blued gray for thee darks.
occassional highlighs of purple/yellow/orange.
in the colages not the rounded edgees -even that little makes huge dif.
softening -ttake it further - blur gently but not shadows. nicepage can auto do this consistently.
non shadows and stuff keeps it a lil 'not too real' - adds that cartoon comfort/simplicity.
subtley is key with stuff like fades etc, 

SIMPLICITY IS KEY WITH THIS PALETTE
