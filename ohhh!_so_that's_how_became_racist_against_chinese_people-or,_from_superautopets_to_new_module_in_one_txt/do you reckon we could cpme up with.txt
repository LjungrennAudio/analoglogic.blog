do you reckon we could cpme up with a better game tan super auto pets with the same concept - do all graphics only using empjis available in the utf16 fontset
i reckon with dif story and gameplay aim it could be way better

very unimaginative specials too considering the nature of some of the items pictured
they just gib animalsfood items to ake em level up

sushi n apples n shit 
surely one can do something way cooler with the colour emojis from utf16 - after all there's some fuckin weird ass shit in there.... 

out on the _**high private use surrogates plane**_ where the weirder characters conglomerate to lurk...
i even am a member of a group chat called "the high private use surrogates club" 
how fucking cool a name is _that_

i love utf unciode fonts so much 
was the utterly most ajutistically nerdy thing i could find to love 
there's over 150,000 chars in the utf charlist since the chinese joined - something like 90,000 chars alone are the fucking chinese shit 
ashats and thier way too many characters clogging up so much real estate of the utf space
>:|
and that's why i'm racist towards chinese people
: D
GOOD TED TALK UH?
my absolute fav non math symbols rn are the mayan calendar numbers
i plan to do an alt firmware for a module that outputs rhythmic voltages  depending on the [phase n stuff of the moon. i tougt to replace with mayan calendar so every 500yrs or w/e it suddenly counts down and shows a shrrom n a red skull ðŸ˜„ LMFAO

could even make an expander of some sport with a pair of those 16x16led blocks and use em in norm mode to show moon phases by cutting out of a circle, but in my mode it shows the chars all cool via utf font 
@.@
\o\

i came up with this idea after learning that the mayan calendar can be stored copletely in one simple approx 25char equation - it's so mathematical. and that i got from a wiki rabbithole on math that lead e to a websoite that is nothing but every single known number sequence of any signoificance or matematical relevance and the equations tat govern it and all associated links. and their search is so powerful you can legit just go hmmmm.... number of wwi #no.1 flying aces - how do i store that lst in kill order in less tban a few huindred bytes? yup - there's a formula!
just imagine - a lil atmega ir arm or raspi running some lil math llm ai that churns the equations - that's an awesome toy when looked up so it outputs voltages/gates/triggers/etc. when it is configured so 
### and that's how NEW _modules_ are made folks!

well - afaic: i love this conceptualising sit mostly, it's like playing with adult lego. i dont actually care _that_ much for the electronics or design aesthetic crap or some of the ergonomics nightmares etc.
but you cant deny - how cool is it for work to be coming up with a thing to code and then you get to make new music with it wen you win!
and you earn munney and can do druqs and go to the fridge whenever and have msuic or tv on and go outside or to bed _and... and... and..._
