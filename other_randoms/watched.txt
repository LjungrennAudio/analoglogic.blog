this year i watched amongst others:
- snowpiercer [although not perfect it kept me glued for 3 seasons and am def gonna watch season four - def worth a watch]
- netflix rotten attempt at live action cowboy bebop [omg that sucked so hard - it was ok as far as the throw away one liner humour moments but thats it. fucking awful. what fail disappoint.]
- altered carbon [couldnt fault it - fucking great]
- arnold [fascinating 3 x 1hr docu interviews with arnold swarzenegger - very insightful, interesting and impressive - total unexpecc]
- get me roger stone [i dont do politics, i dont do news, i dont know squat botu this shit, but even though i'd nee reven eard of him - damn dude has been responsible p much for like 40yrs of presidents getting elected both sides and is the real strong puller behind the whitehouse puppets. he's evil and genius and amazing]
- maniac thought provoking and kinda sorta upsetting but kinda ok scifi story with a different approach to grief and regret. was ok]
- the future of [series of looks into the likely possible future of different aspects of our wold as technology develops - entertainment, dating, food, medicine, transport, buildings etc. - fucking mindbogglingly cool.]
- the plylist [good attempt at telling the story of spotify frommany points of view, trying to be fair and realistic, but some huge fucking flaws and errors that got me so annoyed i wrote a blog article ranting bout it and tweeted at the makers, record companies, streaming services and others]
- scandal! breaking down wirecard [had never even heard of wirecard - fantistic docu on one of the biggest frauds inhistory and fantastically well done - so good]
- the spiders web : great britains second empire [another great docu about how britain didnt lose its emppire after wwii - it just mutated. real intersting and very well made.]
- the pez outlaw [coolest craziest docu about some nutcase who mad millions of dollars off smuggled imported pez...]
- nothing lasts forever [fucking fascinating - i knew diamonds were a fucking monoply owned by de beers and artificially price hiked - but theres so much more]
- the billion dollar code [who fucking knew google stole google maps and then obliterated all evidence becasue they google and they control the information!]
- the great hack [the story of cambridge analytica - fascinating docu, so much more to it than i ever knew]
- madof; the monster of wall street [real good docu telling the complete story of the rise and fall of the madof ponzi scheme that nearly destroyed the entire world economy]
- sisyphus [korean scfi drama that goes on for 1... 6... fucking... stretched out over long too many excessive flashback endless dragged out episodes, bad acting poorly dubbed, rotten korean ballads and awful attempts at stilted highschool drama as far as korean honour/repect/serve type attitude to family, frenships and govt etc. but real good premise and plot arcs and exciting - annoyed by ending too tho.]
- ancient apocalypse [if you enjoy graham hancock thanits best one yet but not soethign for all - docu about ancient civilistations and huge secrets of all sorts.]
- moneyball [i dont know squat bout baseball but even i enjoyed this - cool movie with fantastic cast and astonishing acting]
- costco: what is it in reality? [docu on why costco is a fuckin rip for suckers.]
- running with the devil: the wild world of john mcafee [docu containing the footageshot by vice inteviewing john mcafee from his fleeing a murder charge to supposedly dying in jail - fucking fantastic]
- _every_ bit of _every trailer park boys series, specials, movies, podcasts, outtakes/unseens, swearnet, swearnet movie, europe and america tours, etc. etc. etc. [not all of it's good but it kept me entertained for two weeks solid... :D ]
- inside job animation by rick n morty people - real funny and entertaining]
- new rick n morty [not desolate and bleak but goddamn funny - i enjoyed]
- all of community again again agin [ it's one of the best things ever - i ever get tired of it]
- atlanta [best thing evar. donald glover written, acted, made, music amazing, funny, like twin peaks with black hiphop culture in atlanta - donald glover calls it 'afro surrealism' - my all time fav.]
- gunthers milions [docu about a dog who inheritited $100,000,000 - but it goes deeper and weirder, and then even deeper and even weirder, and more - beyond belief... fucking fascinating and yet all completely true. fav docu i seen all year.]
- ended up rewtching rick n morty ffromscratch, right from the very beginning. [season three stands out a particularly good, its bot bleak/desolate, hilariously funny weird, has good episode biluty to stand alone - you can just pick one and watch it, but aalso there decent overall seaon long plot arcs.]
- i know this isn't netflix or really much of a viewing experience, although technically it is broadcast as video, but, loathe tho i was to admit it at first, it then developed into a guilty pleasure and now i straight up am quite happy to admit it:
jre - the joe rogan experience. it started because i was researching graham hancock and joe rogan is a big fan of his so has had him on his podcast at least 5 or 6 times over the years - but then i worked through all the tom segura appearances, then bert kreischer, the lex fridman, etc., etc. - now i' getting close to having seen all but the mme fighters...
- love, death & robots -[there's no real quite consistent thing that ties together this set of serieses collecting together a bunch of half hr short story type weirdnesses - other than they do fall generally into the broad category of, for the most part, being about love, death and/or robots. there's fantastic scifi, hilarious animation, terrifying pirate horror, zombie claymation, beautiful indian love stories, alternate universes, chinese philosophy - absolutely all sorts...]
- ever-so-oftee i tend to dip into and binge a bit of _community_ - i've probably seen each episode a good 10 times through by now and i still dont tire of them. its just genius.
- 1hr standup specials by any of: bill burr, jim jeffres, mike birbiglia, marc maron, joe rogan, jeff garlin, patton oswalt, tom segura, 
- the cabin with bert kreischer; theoretically just a vehicle for bert kreischer to be funny, but in fact due to the mix of bert kreischers degree of pulling power via fame/netflix, and also just straight up bert knows weird people, the guests are absolutely fantastic and frankly make this worth watching when it wouldn't otherwise be  worth a minute.
- its always sunny in philadelphia; this was one of those things that suffered from too many people telling me how great it was/it being waaaaay talked up at first - so the first coupla time i tried watching it i got aboout 15mins into the first episode and bailed. but then one day i finnally was in he right mood nd sat through a few episodes- and never looked back. the first few maybe arent representative of the quality of the whole, but it really is a true priceless gem of a show. truly utterly funny.
- big bang in tunguska; a somwhat disappointing/boring look into the tunguska meteor [?] explosion.
- the spiders web - britain's second empire; an absolutely fascinating and wonderfuly presented/researched/recounted explanation of the more hidden world behind the reality of britain's financial world empire. fantstic watch.
- district 9;  possibly the single greatest scifi movie ever made - completely different, completely fresh and an entirely different approach to both the genre in general as well as what would theoretically be a very heavily trodden path. an absolute must see.
- limitless; a favourite  movie of mine - wonderfully crafted, clever, near totally believable scifi thriller with soe great plot twists that'll make you want to rush to the bathroom cabinet and abuse your adderall script lol.
- pitch black/chronicles of riddick/riddick; three unique and wonderfully creative scifi movies with a very unusual flavour/atmosphere - in the same way the 'aliens' franchise were very special and made a change from jus a buncha spaceships/laserguns, these again are something fresh and special and well worth watchinng.
- mustn't, ofc, forget _the midnight gospel_; a series of recordings of conversations between the narrator and some very random people including a powrful politician, someone dying of cancer, a respected philosopher and more, all set to very colourful silly animations to give visual accompaniment. extremely rewarding, deals very well with greatly tricksy, powerful topics such as grief, and possibly has had more effect on how i think about the world than anything else ive ever watched.
- can't find the title of it rn, but whatever the docu releasing the footage filmed by vice of the last days of john mcafee before his reported death; i don't want to give spoilers, but simply put, there isn't a second of this that doesn't leave you p much mind bown and glued to the edge of your seat - the guy was terrifying, hilarious, sad, heroic, fascinating, a genius and truy deepy flawed. also, i'm not so sure he's actually dead...
