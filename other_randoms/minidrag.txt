Minidrag (Alaspin)
These are flying snakes, capable of spitting a very corrosive venom. The venom is the most potent on Alaspin; a corrosive neurological poison. There is an antidote, but must be administered within 100 seconds. The minidrag is about a meter long, with a diamond-shaped pattern of pink and blue scales. They are said to be rather standoffish, and their reputation is far in excess of their disposition or numbers. The birth rate is low, and they bear live young with as many as six to a litter. They are empathetic telepaths, and are associate animals with the Dryzam. The minidrag may be the result of selective breeding by the now extinct natives of Alaspin.

Can I eat him, boss?

Loiosh likes to eat things. This is rather understandable.
First realize that the Jhereg are best described as a small, poisonous, flying, snake-like dragon with the intellect of a human. Much to their dismay (and constant ribbing from Vlad) they do not have opposable thumbs. This is probably a good thing. Their culinary habits are much more close to that of a vulture or jackal than a snake or a dragon. It helps get an image of the little guy.

Loiosh paticularly likes (or dislikes) cats. It is probably not coincidence that Vlad Taltos's grandfather (and tutor in witchcraft) has a familiar that is a cat. One of the requests that Loiosh has made is for some catnip. It is suspected that it has no effect upon Loiosh, however he finds it useful as bait.

One has to wonder if the real world parrot who watches over Steven Brust's daughter who is named after the Jhereg (or vice versa?) says similar things.

Loiosh's requests are often responded to with a simple "Shut up Loiosh"

The Curious Coincidence of Minidrags and Jheregs: A Literary Parallel
Sometimes, you stumble across connections in literature that feel too striking to be mere coincidence. Take, for instance, the eerie similarity between Alan Dean Foster's For Love of Mother-Not and Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos series. Both feature fascinating creatures—Foster's Minidrags and Brust's Jheregs—that are strikingly alike in several ways. Let’s dive into this coincidence and explore whether there might be more to it than meets the eye.

The Minidrag: A Telepathic Companion in Foster’s Universe
In For Love of Mother-Not (1983), Alan Dean Foster introduces readers to Minidrags, creatures native to the fictional planet Alaspin. Here’s a quick rundown on the Minidrags:

Appearance: They resemble a meter-long flying snake with distinctive diamond-shaped, pink and blue scales.
Abilities: Minidrags can spit a highly corrosive, neurotoxic venom. There’s an antidote, but it must be administered within 100 seconds to be effective—highlighting just how potent the venom is.
Disposition: Despite their fearsome reputation, Minidrags are actually standoffish and somewhat misunderstood.
Empathy and Telepathy: These creatures are empathetic telepaths, able to communicate non-verbally and bond with specific individuals, notably the Dryzam, who are believed to have selectively bred them.
In the story, Minidrags are rare, and their unusual attributes make them intriguing (and intimidating) companions. They are both respected and feared, making them memorable additions to Foster's world.

The Jhereg: A Witty, Dangerous Companion in Brust’s Fantasy
Then we have Steven Brust’s Jhereg, introduced in the Vlad Taltos series. Brust's series began in the 1980s as well, making it a contemporary of Foster's work. Here’s what we know about the Jhereg:

Appearance: Jheregs are small, snake-like creatures with wings, often described as resembling a cross between a dragon and a snake.
Intelligence: Unlike typical animals, Jheregs possess an intelligence that rivals humans, complete with a sarcastic wit, as exemplified by Loiosh, the protagonist Vlad Taltos's companion.
Disposition: Loiosh is humorous, enjoys making wry comments, and is quite keen on eating—especially if he can annoy Vlad by suggesting it. Like Minidrags, Jheregs are mischievous but ultimately loyal.
Venom and Deadliness: Although it’s not explicitly stated that they have venom, Jheregs are dangerous creatures that are capable of dealing lethal harm.
Loiosh’s personality brings a lot of color to the Vlad Taltos series. He’s more than just a companion; he’s a character in his own right, with complex relationships and even a fondness for catnip as a form of “bait.” The humor and rapport between Loiosh and Vlad add a playful dimension that contrasts with the Jhereg’s predatory nature.

Spotting the Similarities
Let’s break down the uncanny similarities between these two creatures:

Physical Characteristics: Both Minidrags and Jheregs are small, snake-like creatures with the ability to fly. While Jheregs are more dragon-like, the overall resemblance is striking. Neither creature fits neatly into a specific category, embodying traits of both snakes and dragons, with wings that allow for flight.

Dangerous Attributes: Both creatures are known for their lethal capabilities. Minidrags have a corrosive venom, while Jheregs are portrayed as deadly predators in their own right. They are dangerous animals despite their size.

Telepathic or Highly Intelligent Companions: Minidrags are described as empathetic telepaths, capable of forming bonds with specific individuals. Jheregs, on the other hand, have an intelligence equal to humans and can “speak” (telepathically, in a sense) with their human counterparts. This telepathic or deeply connected relationship is rare in the animal companions we typically see in fantasy and science fiction.

Unique Bond with Protagonists: Both creatures are not just sidekicks—they form a significant part of the protagonist’s life. They are close companions who add depth to the main characters (Vlad Taltos in Brust’s work and the Dryzam in Foster’s). Their presence isn’t just decorative; they impact the story and the protagonist’s choices in meaningful ways.

Origin Story: While Brust’s Jheregs don’t have a specific backstory like the Minidrags' selective breeding by the now-extinct natives of Alaspin, both creatures are unique to their respective worlds and carry a sense of being exceptional species. The Minidrags’ history hints at a special, almost mythical origin, while the Jhereg’s intelligence and personality suggest they’re more than ordinary creatures.

Is It Just a Coincidence?
The similarities between Minidrags and Jheregs could simply be a case of convergent creativity—two authors creating similar fantastical animals that fill similar roles in their stories. Flying, snake-like creatures with intelligence and deadly capabilities certainly have an appeal, especially when paired with a protagonist who can communicate with them telepathically. The 1980s was a time when science fiction and fantasy were exploring new boundaries, and it’s possible that both authors were influenced by common tropes of the time.

Another possibility is that one author inspired the other. Although both characters appeared in the 1980s, it’s feasible that Foster’s work (published in 1983) influenced Brust, who might have enjoyed the idea of a unique, venomous, flying creature and adapted it into his own world with a fresh twist.

Final Thoughts: A Tribute to the Power of Unique Companions in Sci-Fi and Fantasy
Whether this is an example of convergent imagination or a subtle tribute, Minidrags and Jheregs are both excellent examples of how much depth and flavor a well-crafted animal companion can add to a story. These creatures aren't just window dressing; they reflect the personalities of their human counterparts, adding layers to the narrative and giving readers someone else to root for (or laugh at).

It’s possible that we’ll never know if this similarity is just a cosmic coincidence, but that’s part of the fun of reading deeply in the worlds of science fiction and fantasy. Sometimes, we stumble on these strange intersections that make us pause, wonder, and appreciate the creativity of the authors who give us such memorable characters.
