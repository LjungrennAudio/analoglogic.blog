tell me you haven't had one of those moments when you become painfully aware that technically, everything you have ever said, typed, done or drawn on any form of electronic device connected to the interwebs is indelibly written ins tone forever like it or nto whether footage of committing a bank robbery caught on security cam or calling some guy a nigger cos they cheated at guitar hero when you were 7. i know realistcally half of it is gone forever or so deeply buried in the absolute morass of crap that makes up the interwebs that unless you did something truly heinous/memorable/unusual/special or somehow are now suddenly in a position of such vulnerabiltiy to being cancelled or security issues of some sort political or w/e that people actually specifically rememeber something well enough to track you down, successfully attribut eit to you and also have it make nany kind of impact upon your life are absoltely near zero, but nevertheless - there's that cold sweat moment in the middle of the night moment for most of us at least brifly once someitme somewhere.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
personally, i like to avoid ever doing anything i'd truly regret, fear or want to take back for any reason in future wrt things i might want to do/be/experience/etc. but nevertheless, tho as a result i am a lil careful about what i post as this conversations shows i'm not ridicuolous - i rant and rave and swear and slur with the best of em and say more vile things than many on averrage cos i am in relaity normally - but sometimes it's wise to not make things tooooo easy
so if i can slightly censor a blog that probably never got a single view and then it is removed from all but the deepest darkest archived searches that someone would have yo befor ehand know existed in orde rto find, that's good enough for me if it makes me sleep better
oh, and i have a specific circumstance that maes it slightly more relevant - i have previous dark experiences of the nhs that make me take a lil car on some issues:


#######

`maybe 27yrs ago, idiot innocent naieve 19yr old kid, not knowing what a cnc kink was i raised my worries about not not quite being certain what was in my head to a mental health professional - fuck knows what they wrote in my notes but somehow a number of years later someone somehow looked at those notes who had no fucking right to whatsover [i.e. completely fucking illegal brach of privacy and patient rights and so on - plain out criminal offence that ofc is unprovable at best and downright invisible at worst] - and for whatever malicious weird creepy reason tried to goad me into saying things that weren't true, got angry when i wouldn't say fucked up shit and my reaction made them look sick n weird and they reported back to the doc a buncha shit i never said - this led to me being labelled for nearly the next 10yrs as possibly violently dangerous to the police and nhs. i've spent the last 27 yrs fght ing this label even tho i have:
- 0 criminal record.
- 0 charges.
- 0 prison time.
- 0 even slight hint of ever doing anything in anyway violent to anyone.
- etc. 
i.e. in no way have i ever done _a n y t h i n g_ illegal other n druqs stuff, yet, veen after fighting with docs n admins n beurocrasy n red tape n various hoispitals n phonecalls with staff n queueing at desks for to be routed elsewhere n endless bossy clerical staff nurses n requested my entire mental health hsitory under freedom of info act, 
[which involved them pulling EVERY paper record from the first time i ever was met by a doc to see why i was acting odd at age 18 - a document stack nearly 2 feet high mostly scrawled handwritten docs observations during hospital stays of endless 'eating ok, mood euthymic, interacts with other patients, eating all meals and sleeping well, etc. etc.] only to find that it was littered with this terrifying absolute lie from the creepy weirdo malicious male nurse who had somehow seen my notes and tried to fuck with me and then got angry when i implied he was the fucking sicko not me, page from other patients notes mixed up who had done stuff like burns someone's house down cos jesus told them to (would you want shit like that about _you _ handed out to another member of the public? name, address, nhs number etc. and all - i coulda ended that guys fucking _life _if i'd been evil and not shredded n burned the fucking lot), and on.
eventually i managed to get someone with a fucking brain to somewhat douse the fucking core fire that had wrongly started this mess but to this day i see traces of what tho clearly censored outta the versions they sent to me under 'we may retain the right to sanitise certain portions of a patients notes by removing words, sentence or entire pages/sections of pages for the patients own protection/health' were still buried in my notes for eternity like it or not, right or wrong - e.g. i went in before xmas to an appointment after being taken to ER for major psychotic hallucinations/delusions/psychoses - sent home with absolutely zero treatment or medication 12hrs later, _still_ experiencing severe audio and visual hallucinations and told there were no beds or doctors so they would book me an outpatient appointment first thing next day - 2 weeks later i still hadn't had a word, still in psychosis i called up and said i'm real upset and angry - so when they paniced and got ,e an appointment next afternoon, apparently the 'angry dangerously violent aggressive evil mental patient with zero history of violence or ever causing trouble, a 175lb 5'7" somewhat weakened person was hustled into the room with the break way hinged door for fast removal straight out backwards behind me, desks arranged to separate the room into a half with me and a half with staff, which mysteriously required for the first time ever two members vs. me sat across and then proceeded to ask questions such as 'why are you crying, are you angry?'

[note: after that appointment along with some disasters involving the taxi they insisted me getting to get to the hospital cos there was no suitable bus,  have no car and it's out walking range, tried to scam me n drive a long way round then charge me £15 for a £3 ride - forcing me in that state to throw a fiver at him whilst disctracc by opening the door of the car right as another passed and run, leaving me with no money to get home, sleep on a bench, then persuade busdriver to let me ride for free home only to be so defeated by the experience i for the first time attempt suicide.]

so yes, i an innocent question about something near commonplace to someone at an age where basically not jsuta  kid but near everyone is thinking and asking  such shit, a wrong place wrong time encounter with some sick fuk witha grudge or w/e and no fear of criminal acts, and where are ya? 25+yrs of hell from absoluetly no crime or even slight criminal thought or intent whatsoever in anyways - permanently tarred and punished for lie. fucked.

i.e. watch what you say online/on cam on any record, it might be use dagainst you it could go awry there is risk and you can somehwat mollify that risk by basically either shutting the fuck up or at least sanitising stuff that when you maybe shoulnt have if you dotn feel fully safe, th sooner you get it the fuck down the better.

scoff all you want bt after an experience of life lie that you think twice.`

#######

btw, i have spent the last 7 yrs living in this house basically with no relationship in real world, no frens, no social life,, rarely going out to the pint from 2019 onwards and increasingly through covid i stopped going out more n more - until it got to the point up to march this yr i hadnt crossed the threshold of my front door since october and havent left the house since march either. 
i havent even gotten dressed in more than a oair of jeans since i last left tnhe hosue in march
i dont cook anymore cos it's just me and i cant be bothered to eat sme thing more n one day in a row or to prep all the effrot just for me.
i have been near continuosuly on druqs since the age of 14 and recieved absilute ero treatement even though i have made e v e r y   s i n g l e  doctor i have had - i.e. psy-fucking-chiatrists that i use, what i use, how much i use and so on and yet recieved absoluelty no suggestioneven of getting anyhelp
i have no cpn or nurse or social worker. never have had.
i have been prescirbed extremely strong antipsychotics including seroquel, quetiaine, and 5 or 6 others - to treat, wait for it, ...OCD. [on the book accepted treatment for ocd? talking therapy involving teaching people to go with the intrusive thoughts instead of fight them until they no longer cause upset]. i learned to deal with it by developing my own oping mechanisms which turn out to be a form of mindfulness - either way absolutely nowhdere does it say it's acceptable to just throw high dose major tranquilisers as they used be called and thrwo someone in the corner to be forgotten

i have had maybe at best 20 docs appoitnments outside of hospital int the last 20yrs.
most of those consisted of 'how have you been?' 'ok, have you been taing your nedication?' 'ok, i'll see you in sic months' only for the next three apppontments to be cancelled and pushed back til 2yrs later the sae cycles round again
no-one ever thought to explain to me why i was given meds i was, why i was given treatments/notes that were written were written/things that were said were said etc. - just left to look shit up on interwebs - leaving me to read shit like the the antipsych i ended up tolerating sufficiently not t be suicidally fucked by side effects operated by making the body produce a hormone shit that emulates a woman in pregnancy - imagine that guilt shame spiral when you're told they think you're a violent threat and then abandoned - easy to convince yourself you're being drugged into some half female messed up hormone deficient wreck as punsihment for crimes falsely accuse and left to rot alone in your house for years with no attention...

so there's a happy tale of caution - one wrong thing, one wrong person and 25+yrs later you have someone so dmagaed they cant even socialise with real human beings face to face, have no life/friends/socialiation/anything, are basically a non person waiting to die, watching each day slide by identically same routine of nothign - wake go in itnterweb social media until sleep, eat occasionally drug occasionally and then eventually coolapse into sleep to repeat again next day.
i'm now so permanently messed up i'm likely beyond abiltiy to resocialise ro renenter a normal life in every day society and basically have lost all hope of doign anything normal ever moe til i fanilly die of suicide or drug overdose accident which ever come sfirst
my on;y relationships or sex life at all consist entirely of what frens i can persuade to come over herre n visit me here in my increasinly hoarderesque house, often onyl cos i pay for passports/tickets etc. as well as chargiong no rent or bills whhilst they stay for six months or a yr and provide all ofood n druqs.as you can imageine this lesves open to massive possible abuses and even more fucked up social catastrophes thatcould easily lead to involven,ent of police or ambulance or mental harm
that's got tot the poiitn ive bailed on my las two possibilitoes o real socialinteraction via visits from frens even tho they werre peoeple i was in a haze of thinking i was in love with due to such fear that they would collapse my world evwen worse than it is an d leave me in hail, homeless or dead.
i live in fear someones gonna get some of my uncesored notes with fucked wrong shit in theirs and end up with an angry mob of locals burning me alive in my own hosue or soemthingowrse
if it werent for druqs i would kille myself 20yrs ago or morr and it's ironically onl due to druqs that my coupla real actual suiicde attemtos faile and i'm still herrew
...

the fantastic irony that after 32yrs of near constant drug use, not always the greatest of diets, near zero exercise, the mental health saga above, total lack of giving a shit about my own well being, attemots to quite luterally bring about the en of my life, an immense and constant intake of mental helth meds known to significantly shorten lfie span, decrease health in general and casue all kinds of unnecessary suffering due side efefects needlessly cuased sicne altewrnative tretaments are available, recommended in preferenece and often near illegally used - in my cas for example wrongly precsibed things, doses way ove that on label with no evidence of having any sinificant extra benefits etc. - yet despite all that there is basically absoluelty fucking nothing wrong with me for my age bar a occasional sciatic nerve thing in one leg and a kiddley stone that hasnt been operated on or sccessfully dissolved or anything - welp., thats p fucking minor chips for all that
if i appear slightly less than a wall of solid muslce and glory but instead slightly gone to seed and balding - welp thank you depakote/valproate semisodium/sodium valproic acid - i.e, mood stabiliser famous for casuing immense wieght gain rarely lsot and loss of hair in accelerated male pattern bakding fashion.... welp, if that's,mthe worst of it,, i'll take it rn tbh - i've come across soooooo many way worse stories.
[thonk of my trnas frens who had the choice of basically death or become a fat bald woman... and there's a fuck ton more fo those sorta choices nsituations peopl fight - i feel blessed someitme sto be frank]
anyways... i'm winding down from my tale of woe that stemmed from why not leave seemingly innocuous comments on an unread blog in a quiet corner of the interwebs
if it halps i'll leace you on some nicer and funner and happier and more uplifting perspective

Out of the last 46yrs:
- I've been high near 32of 'em.
- I've been sharing a house/room/apartment/life with a partner pretty much 90% of the time.
- My average partner has been 10-15yrs younger n me, [tho most recent was near 22yrs younger... >.> - one o those i bailed on when discretion being the better part of valour i decided an untreated bipolar, adhd, ocd, cptsd addled manic lunatic might not be the best person to be involved with when on the surface it looked like me and a 25yr old i.e. not very good for me when things would inevitably turn to all holy disastrous hell :D] .
- Tho i won't claim to have had a complete perfecc scorecard of supermodels, due to a terrible habit of trying to rescue disasters/being a fucking magnet for severely damaged people, a large number of my partners have been things like top 5000 on pornhub/successful camgirls/etc. - i.e. there's plenty of very very hot people no-one else would touch with a 10' pole that i wilfully dived headfirst into and tho may not have been wise... well holy moly are they a wild ride, unbelievable in bed or wherever else they're insane enough to draw you into a fuck, and hence tho I may now been shaving my head to avoid the bald and n longer a slab of muscle anymore - welp I've been engaged to someone who could drink/drug/fuck/etc. me under the table and was chased by the whole fucking town thru to the most recent 25yr old cutie which I swear was solely good timing and a girl who hadn't yet figured out now she no longer weighed 300lbs but 125 and was now fucking gorgeous, somehow hadn't clicked this... :roll_eyes:, and to top it off I've gotten to play with perfecc10 trans girls, trans guys, and all sorts of other sexualities n genders besides (I rly don't think the neighbours have figured out who the fuck makes what out of the people who've stayed for few months to a yr every few months apart for the last decade or so 😄 ) - anyways I digress...
- I've probably done real work maybe 10yrs of my 25yrs of available working life since university.
- I've had complete and utter freedom/independence/volition excepting maybe 3  week -2 week hospitalisations since the day i left home aged 18.
- i've gotten to spend near every second i wanted making music or listening to music or whatever way chose involved in music at anytime, volume, bass level, etc. etc. anytime, anyplace, any anything.
- i've mostly had my own complete privacy in my own home to do drugs/fuck/listen to music etc. etc. - rarely a bother with anyone intruding or bothering me to interefere.
- I've gotten to try pretty much every single druq known to fucking man whether illicit, rare, commonplace, pharmaceutical, new, old, experimental/research related, etc. etc. etc. [and survived undeaded/health damaged/addcited/life destroyed/whatever].
- i've experienced everything from armed raids by terror squad equipped with h&k mp5s, dog team and multiple back up units, arrests, illegal warhouse raves, people needing narcaning etc. afetr oding, all kindsa fucked medical injories n things needing ambiwlans etc., i.e. yup  some real hairy shit too, but l i f e .

and yet ontop of all that otoh;

- i have 10gcse's c-a*, 3 A levels, a BSc(hons) env. energy eng., MRes eng. microbiology, have published research papers on repsected peer reviewed jorunals,
- worked for biotech company doing gen eng./tissue culture/western blots/other genetic assays, spent 15yrs in research lab jobs for universities, etc. etc.
- spent yr living in CA, travelled from CA across to near texas and back covering most of lower half of USA, spent 3months living and travelling whole east coast of australia, visited most countries in western/northern and southern europe, [and surfed every goddamn spot i could in those places whilst there],
- scuba dived on gretabarrier reef, visited rainforests, glaciers, deserts, capital cities n ancient castles/ruins/architecture of immmnse age n importance, the list goes on and fucking on
 
- honestly, i have actually done most of my goddamned bucket list excluding things in asia [ and more time passes i'm honestly not sure i rly wanna go some places, maybe many places in asia :S ]
- i've made nearly 70 something albums n eps - probbably over 1000 full length released tracks in near 30 yrs of music making
- i own and run 2 companies, one successfully for over 13 yrs and its still not only going but expanding and developing as we speak
 
- if i don't get up tomorrow when i wake, don;t do squat, dont do anything ever again whatsover - no matter how long i just lie there high, i will have a rood over head, food in mouth, etc.
- tbh, i've only ever lost one thign in my entire life i truly truly wnat back and wish i hadnt lost - and frankly, everyone has eventually experience loss in some form somhow - so to only suffer one true lost loved one at the age of 45 - welp - that's p fuckin easy going compared to msot i'd argue to matter how significant the loss
- and that of course implies i have known ture absolute utter unconditional true love at least once in my life - and no matter how much it does destroy m to my utter core when i'm let conciousness drift to ward that loss, at leat i haev the comfort of knowign i experienced the love that came before

- I may have somewhat never really been close to family and managed to drift even further apart in the last decade plus, nevertheless, i have people i consider way close rthan any blood relative and so have family of an ersatz variety that tho alil unconventiobal are better than many epople's rela families
 
- i live in a fucking semi-rural idyll - it's green, wooded, rolling hills, safe n secure in peaceful crimeless (if it werent for me) countryside within reachable disatnce of town n city but beyond light piollution, noise or the rest fo the horrors.

- i have all the luxuries of wonderful 21st century living like crazy top of the line powerful computerings, anything delivered in 12-24hrs to my door, not wanting for anything, real good quality non-0city water - like fucking mineral water from the tap, uk weather - never much below freezing and rarely much above 30c for more than a week or two/yr - basically a sound  15-20c most fo the year round - ffs i live in a biome classed as temperate rainforest, sheltered in what is in places a subtropical island due the odd diversion of how the gulf stream n jet stream get pushed off course by geography n geology etc. - basically no earthquakes/tornadoes/hurricanes/poisonous spiders, snakes, scorpions/hostile terrain so bad it's possible to get lost or die/etc. etc., one of the best public health systems in the world - maybe not the bst health system but ive never paid a fucking penny for any ill or injury or antyhing, decent welfare that actually can be lived on, i can go on forever about how fucking lucky i am...

**tldr: anyways, from a cautionary watch what you post/say to what a hell i could claim life is to what a fucking wonder my life is i guess the moral is - you dont know and effectively in all hoinesty have noooooooo fuckign control over life mo matetr how wwell you pan or prep - so fucking live every second an inch to the damned ful.l**

`>>>/wofl out.`
_(sorro - rly dint mean to rambl, you fuckin got me bad there - few too many lines of ritalin and instead of reinstalling back to win10 for a few hrs  then prepping for you i've spent... fuuuuuuck 5 g o d d a m n    hrs emptying my head into your dms. oop)_
😳

you wouldn't be;ieve the temptation to copypasta this into a txt and edit it repeatedly until its no typo, concise, sanitised and perfecc to just dump rather than repeating this effort infututre when needed...
